# Introduction

JavaScript was initially the programming language that was run on web browsers.

When [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) was born, JavaScript became available for programming outside of web browsers (e.g. you can now make a web server with Node.js).

With the dramatic success of Node.js, JavaScript is now "the most-used programming language among software developers" (Flanagan).

## Properties of JavaScript

JavaScript is "a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language" that is suitable for object-oriented and functional programming styles (Flanagan).

JavaScript’s variables are untyped. It has "prototype-based inheritance."

It has nothing to do with Java. (Some of their syntaxes may be similar, though.)

## Standardization of JavaScript

The standardized version of JavaScript was called the "ECMAScript" (or "ES" for short), although everybody just called it JavaScript. This was submitted by Netscape for standardization by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer’s Association).

### ES5

For most of 2010s, ES5 (version 5 of the ECMAScript) has been supported by all web browsers. It introduces the "strict mode" which is meant to "correct" the language's design "mistakes" in pre-ES5 versions.

### From ES6 onwards

Since ES6 (released in 2015), the ECMAScript specification is released on yearly basis as ES2016, ES2017, and so on.

### ESNext

When somebody refers to "ESNext"

## Transpilers

Through transpilers like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), you can write a code in modern JavaScript syntax (e.g. ES5), and "transpile" your code to be read by JavaScript interpreters that have yet to support the new syntax.

This is commonly used to enable the `import` syntax on the code.
