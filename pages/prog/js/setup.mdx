# Setup

There are two ways you can code in JavaScript:

- Using your browser
- Using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Note that there will be differences. For example, you will have the `window` object on your browser, but you will instead have the `process` object on Node.js.

However, to do basic algorithm, you should be able to adapt the code written for the browser for Node.js (and vice-versa).

## 1. Using your browser

1. Hit <kbd>F12</kbd> to open your browser's Developer Tool
2. Select the "Console" tab
3. Type in some code and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```js
console.log('Hello world!');
```

## 2. Using Node.js

Normally, you would follow the installation guide on https://nodejs.org/en/.

However, to make your life easier, I advise you to [install `nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) instead. You should install Node.js through `nvm`. (This makes it easier to change into different version of Node.js, which may happen when you are working on multiple projects/repositories.)

```bash
# E.g. to install Node v16
# (do this when `nvm` has been installed)
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

<NoteBox type="info">
  Note that when you install Node.js, you will also automatically install the matching version of
  NPM (Node Package Manager). You can use NVM to install other people's "libraries" to your project.
</NoteBox>

When `nvm` has been installed, you can create a JavaScript file:

```js
console.log('Hello world!');
```

Then run it:

```bash
# Assuming you save your file at '~/projects/hello/index.js'
node ~/projects/hello/index.js
```
