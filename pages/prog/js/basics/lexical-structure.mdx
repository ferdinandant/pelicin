# Lexical Structure

This is low-level syntax information on how you would write a JavaScript program. You can simply use common sense if you have written any program before.

## Case-Sensitivity

JavaScript is a case-sensitive language:

- Keywords like `while` must be typed as "while", not as "While" or "WHILE"
- `data`, `Data`, and `DATA` are distinct variable names

## Whitespaces

Spaces and tabs between tokens are ignored. Use this to format/indent your program neatly for readability.

```js
// The JS community usually uses 2 spaces to indent codes
if (value < 10) {
  console.log('Not big enough');
  console.log('Try a bigger number');
}
```

## Comments

Comments are used to put remarks/explanations on codes. They are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.

Use `//` to insert a single-line comment:

```js
// Single-line comment
```

Use `/*` and `*/` to insert a multi-line comment:

```js
/*
 * Multi-line comment
 * (The extra '*' characters at the start of each
 * line are optional --- they just look cool)
 */
```

Use `/**` and `*/` to insert a [JSDOC](https://jsdoc.app/) comment (this behaves like a multi-line comment, but your editor may parse this information and provide you with type hints and/or better autocomplete):

```js
/**
 * Checks if `str` is a palindrome
 * (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards)
 * @param {string} str - string to test
 * @returns true iff `str` is a palindrome
 */
function checkIsPalindrome(str) {
  const finalIdxToCheck = Math.floor(str.length / 2);
  const lastIdx = str.length - 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < finalIdxToCheck; i++) {
    if (str[i] !== str[lastIdx - i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

## Identifiers

_Identifiers_ (names for your variables, functions, etc.) must begin with a letter, an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`). Its subsequent characters may be letters, numbers, underscores, and/or dollar signs.

### Reserved keywords

Your identifier also cannot be any of the following keywords:

```
as      const      export     get         null     target   void
async   continue   extends    if          of       this     while
await   debugger   false      import      return   throw    with
break   default    finally    in          set      true     yield
case    delete     for        instanceof  static   try
catch   do         from       let         super    typeof
class   else       function   new         switch   var
```

These might also be added as reserved keywords in the future:

```
enum  implements  interface  package  private  protected  public
```

## Escape character

Use `\` to "escape" a character, making the character(s) that follows it interpreted differently.

### Common escapes

- `\'`, `\"`, or `\\` &mdash; inserts `'`, `"` or `\`
- `\n` &mdash; inserts a newline character
- `\t` &mdash; inserts a tab character

### Unicode characters

You can use Unicode characters directly in your identifiers, strings, and comments.

To write them using ASCII characters, you can write `\uXXXX` or `\u{XXXX}`. (The version with curly braces is introduced in ES6.)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
const π = 3.14;

// These will also work:
// (Note that '\u00E9' is the Unicode for 'é')
// - `let caf\u00e9 = '你要买什么?'`
// - `let caf\u{e9} = '你要买什么?'`
let café = '你要买什么?';
```

<NoteBox type="warning">
  <p>
    <strong>Unicode normalization</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can encode <Code str="café" /> as <Code str="caf\u{00e9}" /> ("caf" + "é") or{' '}
    <Code str="cafe\u{0301}" /> ("cafe" + acute accent combining mark), which, although appear the
    same on text editors, are considered <em>different</em> by JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    "The Unicode standard defines the preferred encoding for all characters. JavaScript assumes that
    the source code it is interpreting has already been normalized and does not do any normalization
    on its own" (Flanagan).
  </p>
</NoteBox>

## Semicolons

Normally, you would end every statement with a semicolon (`;`).

However, JavaScript does not force you to do this. It has what is called [Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Automatic_semicolon_insertion).

### How ASI works

Basially, ASI works like this: if it would be a syntax error if you don't put a semicolon in the line break, then put a semicolon there. For example, in Example 1, `let a a` would be a syntax error, so it put a semicolon inbetween: `let a; a (...)`.

The exceptions to this rule (Flanagan):

- `return`, `throw`, `yield`, `break`, `continue` won't be combined with the next token (Example 3)
- if `++` and `--` are to be used as postfix operator (e.g. `i++`), they must appear on the same line as the expression they apply to
- the `=>` in arrow functions must appear on the same line as the parameter list

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
// Example 1:
let a
a = 3
console.log(a)

// is interpreted as:
let a;
a = 3;
console.log(a);
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
// Example 2:
let y = x + f
(a+b).toString()

// is interpreted as:
let y = x + f(a+b).toString();
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
// Example 3:
return
true

// is interpreted as:
return;
true;
```
