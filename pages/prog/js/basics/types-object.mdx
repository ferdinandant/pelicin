# Object Types

Anything that is not a primitive type is an object type. This includes `Object`, `Array`, `Function`, etc.

Object values are actually _references_ to the physical object in the memory. When you re-assign an object value to a new variable, you are just copying the reference instead of the physical object's value.

Properties of object values:

- **mutable** &mdash; you can change their values (for example, you can change the properties of an object, or the elements of an array).
- **compared by reference** &mdash; Two object values are the same if they refer to the same object in the memory.

## `Object`

An object is essentially a _map_: it maps a _property_ to a _value_:

- The property could be a string or a `Symbol`
- The value could be any JavaScript value, or a getter and/or setter functions.

### Creating an object

You can create an object using an _object literal_

### Accesing object properties

## `Array`

An array is an ordered list of values.
