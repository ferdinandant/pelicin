# Variables

A variable "stores" a value for future uses. We refer them by their _names_. We can "assign" them a new value if we want to.

<NoteBox type="info">
  <p>
    You can use <Code str="console.log(...)" /> to print/show the current value of a variable. Using{' '}
    <Code str="alert(...)" /> can work too, but that's going to be a bit intrusive.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the examples below, we will only assign numbers as values. But there are other kinds of
    values as you shall see later.
  </p>
</NoteBox>

## Declaring variables

You can declare a variable with `let`, `const`, or `var`. Declaring a variable with `const` turns it into a _constant_ that cannot be re-assigned.

### `let`

A variable declared with `let` can be re-assigned:

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      let a = 100;
      let b = 101;
      console.log(a, b); //-> 100 101
    `,
    `
      a = 200;
      b = 201;
      console.log(a, b); //-> 200 201
    `,
  ])}
/>

### `const`

A variable declared with `const` cannot be re-assigned (it's a constant):

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const PI = 3.14159265359;
      console.log(PI); //-> 3.14159265359
    `,
    `
      // A constant cannot be re-assigned
      // The statement below will throw an error
      PI = 123456;
    `,
  ])}
/>

### `var`

This was the only way to declare a variable prior to ES6. This behaves somewhat like `let`, but because of its "quirky" hoisting behavior, you shouldn't use this.

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      // You can actually declare multiple variables in one line using ','
      var a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
      console.log(a, b, c); //-> 1 2 3
      c = -1;
      console.log(a, b, c); //-> 1 2 -1
    `,
  ])}
/>

## Scope of variables

### Scope of `let` and `const`

They are _block-scoped_. Loosely speaking, their scope is between the nearest `{` and `}`. (For `for` loops, the scope includes the loop condition and loop body.)

You _cannot_ redeclare the same variable name twice in the same scope with `let` or `const` (doing so will throw an error).

However, you _can_ declare the same variable name in a nested scope:

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const A = 1;
    `,
    `
      if (A === 1) {
        const A = 2;
        console.log(A); //-> 2
      }
    `,
    `
      console.log(A); //-> 1
    `,
  ])}
/>

### Scope of `var`

They are _function-scoped_. Their scope is the current function, no matter how deep they are declared in the function. (They are "hoisted" to the top of the enclosing function.)

Unlike `let` and `const`, you can redeclare the same variable name multiple times in the same scope with `var`:

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      function myFunction() {
        // This doesn't throw an error because the declaration
        // of \`a\` is "hoisted" to the top of the function 
        console.log(a); //-> undefined
    `,
    `
        // You can redeclare with var multiple times
        var a = 1;
        var a = 2;
        console.log(a); //-> 2
      }
    `,
    `
      myFunction();
    `,
  ])}
/>

## Global variables

Variables that are declared in the top-level scope are _global variables_. They are available everywhere inside their scope.

### Scope of global variables

- In Node.js and client-side JavaScript "modules" (.mjs), the scope of a global variable is the file that it is defined in.
- In traditional client-side JavaScript (the default `<script>`), the scope of a global variable is the HTML document in which it is defined.

### The global object

As of ES2020, you can reliably access the _global object_ using `globalThis`.

- In Node.js, the global object refers to `global` (`globalThis.global`)
- In browsers, the global object refers to `window` (`globalThis.window`)

The global object contains properties that you can refer to directly (as if they are global variables) like `undefined`, `Infinity`, `NaN`, `eval()`, `Date()`, `String()`, `Object()`, etc.

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const globalObject = globalThis;
      const globalPropertyNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(globalObject);
      console.log(globalObject);
      console.log(globalPropertyNames);
    `,
  ])}
/>

### Global variables defined using `let`, `const`, and `var`

- Global variables defined using `let` and `const` cannot be accessed from the `globalThis` property
- Global variables defined using `var` can be accessed from the `globalThis` property (it's like writing `globalThis.myVar = 'something'`)<Asterisk str="*" />

<Asterisk str="*">
  The analogy isn't perfect, though. You cannot do something like{' '}
  <Code str="delete globalThis.myVar" />.
</Asterisk>

## Destructoring assignment

<NoteBox>
  If you don't get what I'm talking about here, just skip this section first and come back after you
  learned objects and arrays.
</NoteBox>
Once you are familiar with arrays and objects, ES6 introduces the shortcut to "extract" properties of
an object or elements of an array.

### Object destructoring

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
      // The same as doing:
      // const a = obj.a;
      // const myB = obj.b;
      const { a, b: myB } = obj;
      console.log(a, myB); //-> 1 2
    `,
  ])}
/>

Note that you can also set the default value of the extracted variable:

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
      const { x, y = 5 } = obj;
      console.log(x, y); //-> undefined 5 
    `,
  ])}
/>

... or even get the rest of the unextracted variables:

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
      const { a, b, ...rest } = obj;
      console.log(rest); //-> { c: 3, d: 4 }
    `,
  ])}
/>

### Array destructoring

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      let [a, b] = arr;
      console.log(a, b); //-> 1 2
      [b, a] = [a, b];
      console.log(a, b); //-> 2 1
    `,
  ])}
/>

Note that you can skip some indices:

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      let [a, , b] = arr;
      console.log(a, b); //-> 1 3
    `,
  ])}
/>

... or even get the rest of the array:

<CodeRunner
  language="js"
  code={smartTrim([
    `
      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      let [a, b, ...rest] = arr;
      console.log(rest); //-> [ 3, 4, 5 ]
    `,
  ])}
/>
