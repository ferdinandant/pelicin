# Volatile Expressions

Marking something as `volatile` prevents the compiler from optimizing accesses related to that variable/expression.

## Use cases

You might want to opt out from code optimization when:

- you are doing some low-level programming (the "redundant" reads/writes to certain addresses may cause side-effects in the system)
- the variable in question may be changed from external sources that the compiler is not aware of

## Examples

### Example 1

The following code:

```cpp
int foo(int& x) {
  x = 10;
  x = 20;
  auto y = x;
  y = x;
  return y;
}
```

might be simplified to:

```cpp
int foo(int& x) {
  x = 20;
  return x;
}
```

To prevent that from happening, you can do:

```cpp
// reads/writes to `x` may cause
// side-effects in the system
int foo(volatile int& x) {
  x = 10;
  x = 20;
  auto y = x;
  y = x;
  return y;
}
```

### Example 2

The following code:

```cpp
int some_int = 100;
while (some_int == 100) {
  doSomething();
}
```

may be optimized to:

```cpp
while (true) {
  doSomething();
}
```

To prevent that from happening, you can do:

```cpp
// `some_int` may be changed from external source
volatile int some_int = 100;
while (some_int == 100) {
  doSomething();
}
```
