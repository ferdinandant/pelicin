# The Basics

<NoteBox type="info">

    <b>The code snippets displayed here are not the full program.</b>

    Normally, you would put them inside the <Code str="main()" /> function of your program. (Don't
    forget to <Code str="#include <cstdio>" /> if you use <Code str="printf" />
    .)

This page shows you some of the basic syntaxes to get you started.

## Comments

Comments are annotations that you write for humans. They are ignored by the compiler.

Use `//` to insert a single-line comment:

```cpp
// Single-line comment
```

Use `/*` and `*/` to insert a multi-line comment:

```cpp
/*
 * Multi-line comment
 * (The extra '*' characters at the start of each
 * line are optional --- they just look cool)
 */
```

## Variables

- Variables are something that store a value.
- You can change the value stored by a variable.
- You refer to a variable by their name.

C++ is a _strongly typed language_, so every variable has a predefined type.

When you declare a variable, you specify their type (e.g. `int` or `bool`) and their name (e.g. `myResult`). Optionally, you can also give them an initial value.

```cpp
// Declaring variables without initial value
int my_number;
bool is_even;

// Declaring variables with initial value
int my_number = 0;
bool is_even = true;
```

## Expressions

Expressions are something that can be evaluated to a value.

You can make an expression by specifying a variable name (the simplest kind of expression), or by using operators (e.g. plus, minus, greater than, etc.).

There are other kinds of expressions not explored here; we will defer them to [Expressions](/prog/cpp/core/expressions).

### Boolean expressions

These expressions evaluate to a boolean (`true` or `false`) value.

- **`a == b`** &mdash; evaluates to `true` if `a` is equals to `b`; `false` otherwise.
- **`a != b`** &mdash; evaluates to `true` if `a` is not equals to `b`; `false` otherwise.
- **`a < b`** &mdash; evaluates to `true` if `a` < `b`; `false` otherwise.
- **`a > b`** &mdash; evaluates to `true` if `a` > `b`; `false` otherwise.
- **`a <= b`** &mdash; evaluates to `true` if `a` &le; `b`; `false` otherwise.
- **`a >= b`** &mdash; evaluates to `true` if `a` &ge; `b`; `false` otherwise.

You can use them as a condition in an `if` statement:

```cpp
// Note that whitespaces (spaces and newlines) are generally ignored.
// I broke and indented the code to make it easier for you to read.
if (my_number < 5)
  printf("my_number is less than 5\n");
else
  printf("my_number is equals to or greater than 5\n");
```

### Assignment expressions

You can change the value stored by a variable by using the assignment (`=`) operator.

```cpp
int a = 1;
printf("Value of a is %d\n", a);
//=> Value of a is 1

a = 2;
printf("Value of a is %d\n", a);
//=> Value of a is 2
```

## Statements

Statements are something that "makes something happens" (Flanagan). In C++, all statements end with a `;`.

### Simple statements

An expression is the simplest kind of statement. For example, an assignment expression is a statement.

```cpp
my_value = 1 + 2;
```

### Control statements

Some other statements control the _flow_ of your program. For example, the `if` statement we discussed earlier:

```cpp
// The `else` clause is optional
if (<condition>) <statement_if_true>;
else <statement_if_false>;
```

### Compound statements

A group of statements can be made using `{...}`.

So, if you need more than one statements in your `if` statement, you can do:

```cpp
if (<condition>) {
  <statement_if_true_1>;
  <statement_if_true_2>;
  <statement_if_true_3>;
} else {
  <statement_if_false_1>;
  <statement_if_false_2>;
  <statement_if_false_3>;
}
```

## Functions

Functions are a block of code that you define once and can be run multiple times.

A function can return a value, or it can return nothing (use return type `void`).

### Declaring a function

Specify the function's return type (e.g. `int`, `bool`, `void`), the function's name (e.g. `addNumbers`), and optionally the parameters' types and names.

Use the `return` expression to "return" from the function (exit the function, and optionally return a value.)

```cpp
int addNumbers(int number_a, int number_b) {
  return number_a + number_b;
}
```

### Calling a function

Specify the function's name and its parameters.

```cpp
int result = addNumbers(2, 3);
printf("Value of a is %d\n", result);
//=> Value of a is 5;
```

## Basic output

We will use `printf` ("print format") to write some output.

- The first argument to `printf` is the _format string_. It's a template string which may contain _format specifiers_ like `%d`. (`%d` is the format specifier for the `int` type; different types have their own format specifier.)

- For each format specifier (`%...`) in the format string, you then pass the values to substitute in as the second (and third, and so on) arguments.

```cpp
int guessNumber = 12;
printf("You guessed %d, and the winning number is %d\n", guessNumber, 18);
//=> You guessed 12, and the winning number is 18
```
