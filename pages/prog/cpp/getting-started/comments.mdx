# Comments

Comments are annotations that you write for humans (explaining what your code does or why you coded it that way). They are ignored by the compiler.

## Single-line comment

Use `//` to insert a single-line comment:

```cpp
// Single-line comment
int a = 5; // You can also put it beside here
```

## Multi-line comment

Use `/*` and `*/` to insert a multi-line comment:

```cpp
/*
 * Multi-line comment
 * (The extra '*' characters at the start of each
 * line are optional --- they just look cool)
 */
int main() {
  return 0;
}
```
