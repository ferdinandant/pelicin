# Object Life Cycle

"An _object_ is a region of storage that has a type and a value" (Lospinoso). Whenever you declare a variable, you create an object.

## Storage duration and lifetime

An object's _storage duration_ begins when storage is allocated for that object, and ends when storage is deallocated for that object. (Memory is reserved for the object during this period.)

An object's _lifetime_ begins when the object's constructor returns, and ends just before the object's destructor is called. (You can use the object during this period.)

Generally:

1. Object's storage duration begins &mdash; storage is allocated
2. Object's lifetime begins &mdash; object's constructor returns
3. _(... you can use the object in your program ...)_
4. Object's lifetime ends &mdash; object's destructor is called
5. Object's storage duration ends &mdash; storage is deallocated

## Types of storage duration

Instead of relying on the _garbage collector_ (aka. automatic memory manager) to automatically deallocates the memory of objects you no longer use, you should know these types of memory management in C++.

### Automatic storage duration

All local variables and function parameters have this storage duration.

- Storage is allocated at the start of the enclosing code block (`{`)
- Storage is deallocated at the end of the enclosing code block (`}`)

```cpp
// `a` and `b` have automatic storage duration
void addOne(int a) {
  int b = 1;
  return a + b;
}
```

### Static storage duration

Variables declared at global scope (or namespace scope), including those declared with the `static` or `extern` keyword, have this storage duration.

- Storage is allocated when the program begins
- Storage is deallocated when the program ends

```cpp
// `a` and `b` have static storage duration
static int a = 100;
extern int b = 200;

// `c` has static storage duration
struct MyClass {
  static int c = 300;
}

// `d` has static storage duration
int main() {
  static int d = 10;
}
```

<NoteBox title="Local static variables">
  Local <Code str="static" /> variables (cppreference.com):
  <ul>
    <li>the storage is allocated when the program begins</li>
    <li>
      the value is initialized the first time control passes through their declaration (except for
      zero or constant initialization, which can be done before the block is first entered).
    </li>
  </ul>
</NoteBox>

<NoteBox title="Normal class member vs static class member">
  <ul>
    <li>Local class members follow the class' storage duration</li>
    <li>Static class members have static storage duration</li>
  </ul>
</NoteBox>

### Thread-local storage duration

Variables declared with `thread_local` have thread-local storage duration.

- Storage is allocated when the thread begins
- Storage is deallocated when the thread ends

```cpp
// `tl_a` has thread-local storage duration
thread_local int tl_a = 1;

// `tl_b` has thread-local storage duration
void myFunction() {
  static thread_local int tl_b = 5;
}
```

<NoteBox
  title={
    <>
      <Code str="thread_local" /> implies <Code str="static" />
    </>
  }
>
  <p>
    <Code str="thread_local" /> can be combined with the <Code str="static" /> or{' '}
    <Code str="extern" /> keyword. If none is specified, <Code str="static" /> is implied.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the initialization of local <Code str="thread_local" /> variables, see "local static
    variable" side note above.
  </p>
</NoteBox>

### Dynamic storage duration

Objects with dynamic storage duration are allocated and deallocated upon your request. These objects are also called _dynamic objects_.

- To allocate storage, use the `new` expression
- To deallocate storage, use the `delete` expression

```cpp
int main() {
  // Simple example with variables
  int* my_int_ptr = new int{ 42 };
  printf("%d\n", *my_int_ptr); //=> 42
  delete my_int_ptr;

  // With array, the length does not need to be a constant.
  // (The length could also be inferred from the init list.)
  const int length = 5;
  int* my_arr_ptr_1 = new int[length]{};
  int* my_arr_ptr_2 = new int[]{ 111, 222 };
  printf("%d %d\n", my_arr_ptr_1[0], my_arr_ptr_1[1]); //=> 0 0
  printf("%d %d\n", my_arr_ptr_2[0], my_arr_ptr_2[1]); //=> 111 222
  // `delete[]` tells the CPU that it needs to clean up multiple variables
  // (`new type[]` keeps track of how much memory was used)
  delete[] my_arr_ptr_1;
  delete[] my_arr_ptr_2;
}
```

<NoteBox type="warning">
  <p>
    You have to make sure that you <Code str="delete" /> dynamic objects once you no longer use them
    (e.g. at the end of the scope or inside the class' destructor).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Not doing this will cause <em>memory leak</em>
    </strong>
    , the condition where your program's memory usage keeps increasing because it does not release the
    memory it no longer uses.
  </p>
</NoteBox>

<NoteBox type="info" title="Dynamic array vs fixed array">
  <p>
    Dynamic arrays (allocated via <Code str="new type[]" />) are stored in the <strong>heap</strong>,
    as opposed to fixed arrays which are stored in the <strong>stack</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>This allows you to allocate large-sized arrays (e.g. arrays with 1,000,000 elements).</p>
</NoteBox>

## Storage duration example

The following code:

```cpp
struct Tracer {
  const char* const name;
  Tracer(const char* name) : name{name} {
    printf("Constructed: %s\n", name);
  }
  ~Tracer() {
    printf("Destructed: %s\n", name);
  }
};

static Tracer t1{ "Global static variable" };
thread_local Tracer t2{ "Thread-local variable" };

int main() {
  // Start of program:
  //=> Constructed: Global static variable

  const Tracer* t2_ptr = &t2;
  //=> Constructed: Thread-local variable

  Tracer t3 = { "Automatic variable" };
  //=> Constructed: Automatic variable

  const auto* t4 = new Tracer{ "Dynamic variable" };
  //=> Constructed: Dynamic variable

  // End of function:
  // Note that 'Dynamic variable' is not destructed!
  //=> Destructed: Automatic variable
  //=> Destructed: Thread-local variable

  // End of program:
  //=> Destructed: Global static variable
}
```

will produce the following output:

```
Constructed: Global static variable
Constructed: Thread-local variable
Constructed: Automatic variable
Constructed: Dynamic variable
Destructed: Automatic variable
Destructed: Thread-local variable
Destructed: Global static variable
```
