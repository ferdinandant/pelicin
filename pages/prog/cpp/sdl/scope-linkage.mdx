# Scope and Linkage

An identifier's _scope_ determines where that identifier can be accessed: within the enclosing block, or within the file. (We say "identifier" because it can refer to a variable, class, or function name.)

An identifier's _linkage_ determines if the identifier is known only to the current file (internal linkage), or to all files (external linkage).

## Scope

A variable can only be accessed within its scope. In addition, only one identifier with the same name can exist in the same scope (ODR, aka. [One Definition Rule](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition)).

### Local scope

- A [local variable](/prog/cpp/getting-started/variables-constants#local-variables) (that is defined inside a function, inside a compound statement block, or is a function parameter) has _local scope_.
- They can only be accessed from their definition until the end of the closest enclosing block (`{...}`).

### File Scope

- A [global variable](/prog/cpp/getting-started/variables-constants#global-variables) (that is defined outside a function) has _file scope_.
- They can be accessed from their definition until the end of the current file.

## Linkage

The concept of linkage only applies to global variables and functions.

Local variables have no linkage because [the linker](/prog/cpp#the-compiler-tool-chain) won't see it (their scope is limited and they only exist when the function is being called).

### Internal linkage

Identifiers with internal linkage can only be accessed inside the current translation unit (inside the current file).

- Global variables or functions with the `static` keyword have internal linkage
- Global constants have internal linkage by default

```cpp
// Internal linkage (because of `static`)
static int damage = 0;

// Internal linkage (because it's a global constant)
const int MAX_HP = 100;
```

### External linkage

Identifiers with internal linkage can be accessed by other translation units (by other files).

- Global variables or functions with the `extern` keyword have external linkage
- Global variables have external linkage by default
- Functions have external linkage by default

```cpp
// External linkage (because it's a global variable)
int number_a = 20;

// External linkage (because of `extern`)
extern int number_b = 20;

// External linkage (because it's a function)
void sayHi() {
  printf("Hello!\n");
}
```

## Using global variables from other files

To actually use global variables with external linkage from other files, you have to use [forward declarations](#TODO).

```cpp
// fileA.cpp
// Declaration and definition
extern int my_var = 42;
extern const int MY_CONST = 10;
```

```cpp
// fileB.cpp
// Forward declaration only
extern int my_var;
extern const int MY_CONST;
```
