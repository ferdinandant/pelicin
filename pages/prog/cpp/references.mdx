# References

For this module, I mainly use the following reference(s):

- [_C++ Crash Course_](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/c-crash-course/9781098122553/) by Josh Lospinoso &mdash; the main reference. The book is available via subscription on learning.oreilly.com.
- [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) &mdash; as occasional side reference
- _Pemrograman C++: Mudah dan Cepat Menjadi Master C++ dengan Mengungkap Rahasia-Rahasia Pemrograman C++_ by Budi Raharjo &mdash; for chapter organization

I also use my preexisting programming knowledge to helpfully explain some concepts in a simpler way.
