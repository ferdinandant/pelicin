# Virtual Base Classes

In multiple inheritance, _virtual base classes_ ensure there is only one object of that base class in the inheritance tree.

(Normally, each "branch" of superclass would create their own superclasses independently, see example below.)

## Declaring virtual base classes

When you specify a class' superclass(es), prefix them the `virtual` keyword.

```cpp
class Derived : virtual public Base {
  Derived() {};
};
```

## The problem with multiple inheritance

### The diamond problem

With multiple inheritance, when a class has multiple superclasses, the superclass of its superclasses is constructed once for each superclass.

Consider the following example:

```cpp
struct ClassA {
  ClassA() {
    printf("ClassA initialized\n");
  }
};

struct ClassB : ClassA {
  ClassB() {
    printf("ClassB initialized\n");
  }
};

struct ClassC : ClassA {
  ClassC() {
    printf("ClassC initialized\n");
  }
};

struct ClassD : ClassB, ClassC {
  ClassD() {
    printf("ClassD initialized\n");
  }
};

int main() {
  ClassD d = {};
  //=> ClassA initialized
  //=> ClassB initialized
  //=> ClassA initialized
  //=> ClassC initialized
  //=> ClassD initialized
}
```

Even though conceptually the inheritance works like the picture on the left, it actually works like the picture on the right (`ClassC` and `ClassD` have their own copy of `ClassA`):

      Logical vs actual class diagram: <Code str="ClassC" /> and <Code str="ClassD" /> have their
      own copy of <Code str="ClassA" />
    </>
  }
/>

### Solving the diamond problem

If you only want one copy of `ClassA`, you should mark `ClassA` as a virtual base class.

In the example below, by marking `ClassA` as a virtual base class in `ClassB` and `ClassC`,

- the class that is responsible for creating `ClassA` would be `ClassD` (as the most derived class) &mdash; you can directly initialize `ClassA` in `ClassD`'s member initialization list
- initilization of `ClassA` in `ClassB`'s and `ClassC`'s member initialization list will be ignored (unless you are instantiating a member of `ClassB` or `ClassC`)

```cpp
struct ClassA {
  ClassA() {
    printf("ClassA initialized\n");
  }
};

struct ClassB : virtual ClassA {
  ClassB() {
    printf("ClassB initialized\n");
  }
};

struct ClassC : virtual ClassA {
  ClassC() {
    printf("ClassC initialized\n");
  }
};

struct ClassD : ClassB, ClassC {
  ClassD() {
    printf("ClassD initialized\n");
  }
};

int main() {
  ClassD d = {};
  //=> ClassA initialized
  //=> ClassB initialized
  //=> ClassC initialized
  //=> ClassD initialized
}
```

## Behaviors of virtual base classes

- Virtual base classes will be created before non-virtual base classes.
- The class that is reponsible for creating the virtual base class is the most derived class.
