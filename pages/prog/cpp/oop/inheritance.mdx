# Inheritance

From any class, you can make _subclasses_ from that class.

- The original class is also known as the _base class_ or the _superclass_
- The subclass(es) is also known as the _derived class(es)_

Subclasses _inherit_ non-`private` members of their superclasses.<Asterisk str="*"/> This means that the subclasses can access the superclasses' `public` or `protected` "data" or "functions" as if they were their own.

Subclasses can also define new members, and/or _override_ inherited members. (The members defined in the subclass will be chosen over inherited members.)

<Asterisk str="*">
  And non-
  <Code str="private" /> members of their superclasses' superclasses, if the inheritance type (public,
  protected, or private) allows it.
</Asterisk>

## Defining subclasses

<NoteBox>
  We use <Code str="struct" /> here to just simplify the code (making the access specifiers{' '}
  <Code str="public" />
  by default). You may use <Code str="class" /> in real-world scenario.
</NoteBox>

### Single inheritance

The most common type of inheritance is single inheritance, where a subclass only inherit from one superclass.

Below, we define `StudentUser` and `TeacherUser` as subclasses of `User`.

```cpp
struct User {
  char name[255];
};

struct StudentUser : User {
  int score = -1;
  void printReport() {
    printf("Student %s's score is %d\n", name, score);
  }
};

struct TeacherUser : User {
  char subject_taught[255];
  void printReport() {
    printf("Teacher %s teaches %s\n", name, subject_taught);
  }
};
```

### Multiple inheritance

You can have one subclass inherits from multiple superclasses, however this pattern is not recommended (hard to maintain).

```cpp
struct USBDevice {
  int id = 0;
  int getID() {
    return id;
  }
};

struct NetworkDevice {
  int id = 0;
  int getID() {
    return id;
  }
};

// Inheriting from two superclasses
struct WirelessAdapter : USBDevice, NetworkDevice {
  WirelessAdapter(int usbDeviceID, int networkDeviceID)
    : USBDevice{usbDeviceID},
      NetworkDevice{networkDeviceID}
  {}
};
```

### Specifying public, protected, or private inheritance

You can specify the type of inheritance (`public`, `protected`, or `private`) before the superclass' name. By default, if you do not specify the type of inheritance:

- If the subclass is defined using `struct`, it will use public inheritance
- If the subclass is defined using `class`, it will use private inheritance

```cpp
struct StudentUser : public User {};

struct WirelessAdapter : public USBDevice, public NetworkDevice {};
```

#### Public inheritance

From the subclass' perspective, when you try to access the inherited members through the subclass (recall that `private` members are not inherited):

- The superclass' `public` members stay `public`
- The superclass' `protected` members stay `protected`

#### Protected inheritance

From the subclass' perspective, when you try to access the inherited members through the subclass (recall that `private` members are not inherited):

- The superclass' `public` members become `protected`
- The superclass' `protected` members stay `protected`

#### Private inheritance

From the subclass' perspective, when you try to access the inherited members through the subclass (recall that `private` members are not inherited):

- The superclass' `public` members become `private`
- The superclass' `protected` members become `private`

## Initializing superclass

### Constructor call order

When you instantiate a subclass, **the superclass' constructor is called first**, then the subclass' constructor ("constructors are called from top to bottom").

### Initializing superclass via member initializer lists

You CANNOT initialize inherited members from the subclass' member initializer lists. Instead, you just initialize the supcerclass directly from the subclass' member initializer lists.

```cpp
struct BaseClass {
  int base_id_a;
  int base_id_b;
  BaseClass(int base_id_a, int base_id_b)
    : base_id_a{base_id_a},
      base_id_b{base_id_b}
  {}
};

// We choose the following constructor of `BaseClass`
// BaseClass(int base_id_a, int base_id_b)
struct DerivedClass : BaseClass {
  int derived_id;
  DerivedClass(int derived_id, int base_id_a, int base_id_b)
    : BaseClass{base_id_a, base_id_b},
      derived_id{derived_id}
  {}
};

int main() {
  DerivedClass dc = { 1, 2, 3 };
  printf("%d %d %d\n", dc.derived_id, dc.base_id_a, dc.base_id_b);
  //=> 1 2 3
}
```

## Overriding superclass

On top of defining their own "data" and "function" members, within subclass definitions, you can also do the following.

### Changing inherited members' access specifier

Use the `using` keyword, mentioning the inherited member's name below the appropriate access specifier.

```cpp
class Base {
 protected:
  int secret_id;
  int getSecretID() {
    return secret_id;
  }
 public:
  Base(int secret_id) : secret_id{secret_id} {}
};

class Derived : Base {
 public:
  Derived(int secret_id) : Base{secret_id} {}
  // Make `secret_id` and `getSecretID` public
  // (because we place this under "public:")
  using Base::secret_id;
  using Base::getSecretID;
};

int main() {
  Derived derived = { 123 };
  // Normally, you can't do this because these members are protected
  // (but we changed them to public using the `using` declaration
  printf("%d\n", derived.secret_id); //=> 123
  printf("%d\n", derived.getSecretID()); //=> 123
}
```

### Deleting an inherited function

Assign `= delete` to the function. Only function members can be deleted.

Once you delete an inherited function, you can no longer call that function inside the subclass or publicly through the subclass.<Asterisk str="**"/>

```cpp
class Base {
 private:
  int secret_id;
 public:
  int getSecretID() {
    return secret_id;
  }
  Base(int secret_id) : secret_id{secret_id} {}
};

// We use public inheritance here to show
// how you can call the deleted function through
// the base class (using `static_cast<Base&>`)
class Derived : public Base {
 public:
  Derived(int secret_id) : Base{secret_id} {}
  int getSecretID() = delete;
};

int main() {
  Derived derived = { 123 };
  // The following line causes compile error
  // (Attempt to use a deleted function):
  // printf("%d\n", derived.getSecretID()); //=> COMPILE ERROR!
}
```

<Asterisk str="**">
  This does not prevent somebody from accessing the fuction through the superclass, e.g. by casting
  the subclass as the superclass: <Code str="(static_cast<Base&>(derived)).getSecretID()" />
  <Asterisk str="***" />
</Asterisk>

<Asterisk str="***">
  This requires <Code str="Derived" /> to use public inheritance from <Code str="Base" />, otherwise
  you will get "Cannot cast 'Derived' to its private base class 'Base'" compilation error
</Asterisk>

### Overriding an inherited function

Just reimplement the function in the subclass.

Note that this will completely "replace" the inherited function from the subclass' perspective.

```cpp
struct Base {
  void printMessage() {
    printf("I'm base!\n");
  }
};

struct Derived : Base {
  void printMessage() {
    printf("I'm derived!\n");
  }
};

int main() {
  Derived d = {};
  d.printMessage();
  //=> I'm derived!
}
```

### Calling an inherited function

You can call a superclass' function by scoping them with the superclass' name (even after you have overridden them):

```cpp
struct Base {
  void printMessage() {
    printf("I'm base!\n");
  }
};

struct Derived : Base {
  void printMessage() {
    Base::printMessage();
    printf("I'm derived!\n");
  }
};

int main() {
  Derived d = {};
  d.printMessage();
  //=> I'm base!
  //=> I'm derived!
}
```

## Working with subclasses

### Instantiating subclasses

Instantiate them just like any other classes.

```cpp
// Using the default constructor
// (initializing all public members of the class)
StudentUser student = { "Alice", 99 };
TeacherUser teacher = { "Bob", "math" };

student.printReport();
//=> Student Alice's score is 99
teacher.printReport();
//=> Teacher Bob teaches math
```

### Object slicing

Object slicing occurs when you assign a subclass type to its superclass type. (Semantically, you try to copy an object of a subclass type to a superclass type.)

The superclass part of the object will be copied over, but subclass members information of the subclass will be lost ("sliced off").

**Object slicing does not happen with pointers and references** (as they do not make a copy). This will become apparent when we talk about [virtual functions](/prog/cpp/oop/virtual-functions).

```cpp
struct User {
  int id;
  char name[255];
  char* getType() {
    static char type[] = "User";
    return type;
  }
};

struct StudentUser : User {
  int score = -1;
  char* getType() {
    static char type[] = "StudentUser";
    return type;
  }
};

// Object slicing may happen here
// (When you assign type of `StudentUser` to `User`,
// it creates a copy, but only for the superclass part)
void printUserInformation(User user) {
  printf("%s: %s\n", user.getType(), user.name);
}

int main() {
  User user = { 1, "Eve" };
  StudentUser student_user = { 2, "Alice", 99 };
  printUserInformation(user); //=> User: Eve
  printUserInformation(student_user); //=> User: Alice

  // The expression below creates a COPY
  // of `User` from `StudentUser`
  User user_copy = student_user;
  user_copy.id = 555;
  // We can proof that it's a copy by modifying
  // one of its primitive member data
  printf("%d\n", student_user.id); //=> 2
  printf("%d\n", user_copy.id); //=> 555
}
```

### Resolving ambigous member access in multiple inheritance

> "I told you not to use multiple inheritance."

Trying to access an ambiguous member name in multiple inheritance causes compile error, so you will have to scope them (specifying which class member to use):

```cpp
// Using multiple inheritance example above
// - USBDevice's `id` = 1
// - NetworkDevice's `id` = 2
WirelessAdapter wa = { 1, 2 };

// Without specifying the scope, you will get compile error
// (Member 'getID' found in multiple base classes of different types):
// printf("%d\n", wa.getID()) //=> COMPILE ERROR!
printf("%d\n", wa.NetworkDevice::getID()); //=> 2
```
