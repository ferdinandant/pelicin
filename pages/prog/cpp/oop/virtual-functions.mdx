# Virtual Functions

Virtual functions are functions that resolve to the most-overridden version of themselves (depending on the original class of the object).

This resolving behavior _may_ incur performance overhead when virtual functions are called, but the compiler may do some optimization to reduce or remove this overhead.

## Definitions

### Virtual functions

Use the `virtual` keyword before their definition:

```cpp
struct MyClass {
  virtual void myFunction() {
    printf("I'm a virtual function\n");
  }
};
```

### Pure virtual functions

_Pure virtual functions_, also known as _abstract functions_, are virtual functions that do not have a body (you just suffix them with `= 0`).

This is a way to "force" the subclasses to override the function, because you cannot instantiate classes that have a pure virtual function(s).

```cpp
struct MyClass {
  virtual void myFunction() = 0;
};
```

### Abstract classes

Classes that have pure virtual function(s) are called _abstract classes_. They cannot be instantiated.

Subclasses of an abstract class should provide the body/implementation for the pure virtual functions, otherwise they become abstract classes as well.

```cpp
struct MyClass {
  virtual void myFunction() = 0;
};

// Variable type 'MyClass' is an abstract class:
// MyClass my_class = {}; //=> COMPILE ERROR!
```

### Interface classes

_Interface classes_, or _pure-virtual classes_, are classes that:

- do not have member variables, and
- all of their functions are pure virtual functions.

They are essentialy "contracts" that specify what functions should their subclasses implement. (They only contain definitions and no implementation.)

<NoteBox type="warning">
  You should specify a virtual destructor for interface classes, otherwise memory leak can occur
  (because the derived destructor may not be called).
</NoteBox>

```cpp
struct IErrorLog {
  virtual bool openLog(const char *filename) = 0;
  virtual bool closeLog() = 0;
  virtual bool writeError(const char *errorMessage) = 0;
  virtual ~IErrorLog() {}
};
```

## Override and final specifiers

### `override`

Adding the `override` specifier to a function definition ensures that the function overrides a virtual function. Only virtual member functions can be marked `override`.

If the function marked `override` does not override the base virtual function (e.g. you used a non-matching type), you will get a compile error.

<NoteBox type="success">
  It is considered best practice to add <Code str="override" /> to virtual function overrides.
  (There is no overhead and you get the type-checking benefit.)
</NoteBox>

```cpp
struct ClassA {
  virtual void printHello() {
    printf("Hello from ClassA\n");
  }
};

struct ClassB : ClassA {
  void printHello() override {
    printf("Hello from ClassB\n");
  }
};
```

### `final`

Adding a `final` specifier to a function definition ensures that the function is not overridden by any subclasses. Only virtual member functions can be marked `final`.

Trying to override a function marked `final` will cause a compile error.

```cpp
struct ClassA {
  virtual void printHello() {
    printf("Hello from ClassA\n");
  }
};

struct ClassB : ClassA {
  void printHello() final {
    printf("Hello from ClassB\n");
  }
};
```

## Behaviors of virtual functions

### Virtual function resolution

A function is considered an override to a virtual function only if:

- their return types are the same (or they use _covariant return types_: i.e., if the base function returns a pointer or reference to a class, the override function can return a pointer or reference to that class' subclass),
- their argument types and lengths are the same,
- they are both `const` or both NOT `const`.

Example of virtual functions returning covariant return types is as follows (note how the returned pointer type is upcasted, because the override function returns `Derived*`, while the base function returns `Base*`):

```cpp
struct Base {
  virtual Base* getThis() {
    printf("getThis from Base\n");
    return this;
  }
  void printHello() {
    printf("printHello from Base\n");
  }
};

struct Derived : Base {
  // The following does not make a compile error!
  virtual Derived* getThis() override {
    printf("getThis from Derived\n");
    return this;
  }
  void printHello() {
    printf("printHello from Derived\n");
  }
};


int main() {
  Derived d = {};
  Base* b = &d;
  // `b->getThis()` would call `Derived::getThis()`, but
  // since the base function returns `Base*`, the `Derived*`
  // return type is upcast to `Base*`.
  b->getThis()->printHello();
  //=> getThis from Derived
  //=> printHello from Base
}
```

### Only works with pointers and references

When you make a copy of the subclass-type and assign it to the superclass-type, [object slicing](</prog/cpp/oop/inheritance#copying-a-subclass-type-object-into-a-superclass-type-object-(object-slicing)>) occurs and overridden virtual functions are not considered (because that information is lost).

With pointers and references, however, information about the subclass is not lost. Virtual functions resolved through pointers and references will point to their most-derived version.

```cpp
struct Base {
  void normalFunction() {
    printf("Base: normal\n");
  }
  virtual void virtualFunction() {
    printf("Base: virtual\n");
  }
};

struct Derived : Base {
  void normalFunction() {
    printf("Derived: normal\n");
  }
  virtual void virtualFunction() {
    printf("Derived: virtual\n");
  }
};

int main() {
  Derived derived = {};
  Base base_upcast = derived;
  // The resolving behavior does not happen with normal class type
  // because only the superclass part of the object gets copied;
  // subclass member information are lost (object slicing):
  base_casted.normalFunction(); //=> Base: normal
  base_casted.virtualFunction(); //=> Base: virtual (not resolved to subclass)

  Base* base_upcast_ptr = &derived;
  Base& base_upcast_ref = derived;
  // The resolving behavior works with pointers and references:
  base_upcast_ptr->normalFunction(); //=> Base: normal
  base_upcast_ptr->virtualFunction(); //=> Derived: virtual (surprise!)
  base_upcast_ref.normalFunction(); //=> Base: normal
  base_upcast_ref.virtualFunction(); //=> Derived: virtual (surprise!)
}
```

### Only resolves until the original class of the object

Resolving virtual functions will not go past the original class of the object.

```cpp
struct ClassA {
  virtual void print() {
    printf("ClassA\n");
  }
};

struct ClassB : ClassA {
  virtual void print() {
    printf("ClassB\n");
  }
};

struct ClassC : ClassB {
  virtual void print() {
    printf("ClassC\n");
  }
};

int main() {
  ClassB class_b = {};
  ClassA* class_a_ptr = &class_b;
  ClassA& class_a_ref = class_b;
  // These does not print "ClassC"
  // because the original type is `ClassB`
  class_a_ptr->print(); //=> ClassB
  class_a_ref.print(); //=> ClassB
}
```

### Gotchas: `this` and virtual table

(Currently I cannot explain why the following code works like they do.)

```cpp
struct Base {
  void callNormalFn() {
    normalFn();
  }
  void callVirtualFn() {
    virtualFn();
  }
  void normalFn() {
    printf("Base::normalFn\n");
  }
  virtual void virtualFn() {
    printf("Base::virtualFn\n");
  }
};

struct Derived : Base {
  void callNormalFn() {
    Base::callNormalFn();
  }
  void callVirtualFn() {
    Base::callVirtualFn();
  }
  void normalFn() {
    printf("Derived::normalFn\n");
  }
  virtual void virtualFn() {
    printf("Derived::virtualFn\n");
  }
};

int main() {
  Derived d = {};
  d.callVirtualFn();
  //=> Derived::virtualFn (surprise!)
  d.callNormalFn();
  //=> Base::normalFn (surprise!)
}
```
