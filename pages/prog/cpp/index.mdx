# Introduction

Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ from the C programming language. It added "facilities for better type checking, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming" to C (stroustrup.com).

The ubiquity of C in system programming is because of its zero-overhead principle and its higher level of abstraction than writing in assembly. C++ adheres to these principles as well.

It is now "one of the world's most widely used, high-performance, computer-programming languages" (Deitel et al.).

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, world!");
  return 0;
}
```
