# Introduction

Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ from the C programming language. It added "facilities for better type checking, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming" to C (stroustrup.com).

The ubiquity of C in system programming is because of its zero-overhead principle and its higher level of abstraction than writing in assembly. C++ adheres to these principles as well.

It is now "one of the world's most widely used, high-performance, computer-programming languages" (Deitel et al.).

## Sample C++ code

A simple C++ program looks like the following.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

- At the top part of your code, you `#include` (import) the libraries that you want to use. In this case, we include `cstdio` that defines `printf()`.
- All C++ programs have the `main()` function as its _entry point_. Your program will start running from this function.
- The `main()` function's return value (if you write any `return` statement) would denote the _exit code_ of your program; it defaults to 0. (Exit code 0 generally means your program ran succesfully.)

## The compiler tool chain

To convert your source code into an executable program, the C++ _compiler tool chain_ (or _tool chain_) is a collection of these three elements that run one after another:

- **The preprocessor** &mdash; performs basic source code manipulation (e.g. include information about the libraries that you used). For each file processed, it outputs a single _translation unit_.
- **The compiler** &mdash; reads a _translation unit_ and generates an _object file_ (it contains data and instructions in an intermediate format most people won't understand).

- **The linker** &mdash; reads _object files_, links them together (along with library codes), and generates a program.
