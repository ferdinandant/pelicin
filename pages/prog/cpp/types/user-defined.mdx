# User-Defined Types

User-defined types are types that you define yourself.

## Unscoped enumeration

<NoteBox type="warning">
  <p>
    Unscoped enumeration are "less safe" to use than scoped enumeration (see next section). They are
    supported in C++ for historical reasons and interoperability with C.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Use scoped enumeration whenever possible.</strong>
  </p>
</NoteBox>

Enumerations are types that only permit certain values. Under the hood, these "values" are just integers.

To define an unscoped enumeration, use the `enum` keyword:

```cpp
enum Element {
  Fire,
  Water,
  Nature,
  Dark,
  Light,
};

Element monsterElement = Dark;
Element playerElement = Light;
```

## Scoped enumeration

Scoped enumeration works like unscoped enumerations, except:

- you use `enum class` to define them, and
- you have to "scope" the values when you mention them

```cpp
enum class Element {
  Fire,
  Water,
  Nature,
  Dark,
  Light,
};

Element monsterElement = Element::Dark;
Element playerElement = Element::Light;
```

## Unions

Unions behave like an "or" type.

In the example below, `Variant` is either a `char[10]` type, an `int` type, OR a `double` type. An union's value is stored in the same memory address, and you are responsible to "keep track" which data type it is currently using.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

union Variant {
  char string[10];
  int int_number;
  double double_number;
};

int main() {
  Variant v;
  v.int_number = 42;
  printf("Current v: %d\n", v.int_number);
  //=> Current v: 42

  v.double_number = 2.7182818284;
  printf("Current v: %lf\n", v.double_number);
  //=> Current v: 2.718282

  // `v` is currently storing a double value
  // from the last assignment, so trying to read
  // it as `int` will give a gibberish result.
  printf("Current v: %d\n", v.int_number);
  //=> Current v: -1961734133
}
```
