# Primitive Types

Primitive types (or fundamental types) are built-in types that are part of the core language, and almost always available to you.

These types will work on any platform, but their features (e.g. size and memory layout) may differ depending on the infrastructure.

<NoteBox type="info" title='"F.S."'>
  <p>
    Each type has their own <Code str="printf()" /> <dfn>format specifier</dfn>, which I will
    abbreviate "F.S."
  </p>
  <p>
    You will normally use this format specifier to print a variable/expression of that type using{' '}
    <Code str="printf()" />.

## Integer types

These store integers (whole numbers).

### Types of integer types

- There are four sizes: `short` (2 bytes), `int` (4 bytes), `long` (4 or 8 bytes), and `long long` (8 bytes).

  - Thanks to [the specification](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13398763/5181368), `long` can be 4 bytes or 8 bytes. (It's 8 bytes on 64-bit Linux or Mac; 4 bytes elsewhere.)

- Each integer type can be signed (e.g. `int`) or unsigned (e.g. `unsigned int`)
  - If signed, it can store negative, zero, and positive values
  - If unsiged, it can store zero and positive values only

| Type                 |     Size     |                  Min value                   |              Max value               |  F.S.  |
| -------------------- | :----------: | :------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: | :----: |
| `short`              |   2 bytes    |                &minus;32,768                 |                32,767                | `%hd`  |
| `unsigned short`     |   2 bytes    |                      0                       |                65,535                | `%hu`  |
| `int`                |   4 bytes    | &approx; (&minus;2.14)&times;10<sup>9</sup>  |  &approx; 2.14&times;10<sup>9</sup>  |  `%d`  |
| `unsigned int`       |   4 bytes    |                      0                       |  &approx; 4.29&times;10<sup>9</sup>  |  `%u`  |
| `long`               | 4 or 8 bytes |                   &mdash;                    |               &mdash;                | `%ld`  |
| `unsigned long`      | 4 or 8 bytes |                   &mdash;                    |               &mdash;                | `%lu`  |
| `long long`          |   8 bytes    | &approx; (&minus;9.22)&times;10<sup>18</sup> | &approx; 9.22&times;10<sup>18</sup>  | `%lld` |
| `unsigned long long` |   8 bytes    |                      0                       | &approx; 18.44&times;10<sup>18</sup> | `%llu` |

### Integer literals

When we say _literal_, it means hardcoded values in your program.

- **To write in decimal** &mdash; just write the number normally, e.g. `1234` or `-1234`
- **To write in ocatal (base 8)** &mdash; prefix the number with `0`, e.g. `067` or `-067`
- **To write in binary (base 2)** &mdash; prefix the number with `0b`, e.g. `0b0011` or `-0b0011`
- **To write in hexadecimal (base 16)** &mdash; prefix the number with `0x`, e.g. `0x9ab` or `-0x9ab`

When you write an integer literal, the compiler will assume its type as either `int`, `long`, or `long long` (it will pick the smallest one that fits). If you want more control, you can narrow down its type by suffixing it with any of these (they are case insensitive).

- **`l` or `L`** &mdash; to make it a SIGNED `long` (or `long long`)
- **`ll` or `LL`** &mdash; to make it a SIGNED `long long`
- **`u` or `U`** &mdash; to make it an `unsigned int` (or `unsigned long` or `unsigned long long`)
- **`ul` or `UL`** &mdash; to make it an `unsigned long` (or `unsigned long long`)
- **`ull` or `ULL`** &mdash; to make it an `unsigned long long`

### Formatting integers

- **`%o`** &mdash; format-print an integer type in its octal representation
- **`%x`** &mdash; format-print an integer type in its hexademical representation

```cpp
int number = 123;
printf("%d in HEX is %x!\n", number, number);
//=> 123 in HEX is 7b!
```

## Floating-point types

These store _approximations_ of real numbers. (Because the space to store the numbers are limited, there could be _precision errors_ when representing real numbers.)

### Types of floating-point types

`long double` is usually the same as `double` (just use `double`).

| Type          |  Size   |                   Min value                   |              Max value               | F.S.  |
| ------------- | :-----: | :-------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: | :---: |
| `float`       | 4 bytes | &approx; (&minus;3.40)&times;10<sup>38</sup>  | &approx; 3.40&times;10<sup>38</sup>  | `%f`  |
| `double`      | 8 bytes | &approx; (&minus;1.79)&times;10<sup>308</sup> | &approx; 1.79&times;10<sup>308</sup> | `%lf` |
| `long double` | 8 bytes | &approx; (&minus;1.79)&times;10<sup>308</sup> | &approx; 1.79&times;10<sup>308</sup> | `%Lf` |

### Floating-point literals

There are two ways to write a floating-point literal:

- **Write it normally** &mdash; e.g. `123.45`, `-123.45`, `456` (integer literals are valid, too)
- **Write it in scientific notation** &mdash; e.g. `1.9e2` (1.9&times;10<sup>2</sup>) or `-2.1e-2` (&minus;2.1&times;10<sup>-2</sup>)

When you write a floating-point literal, the compiler will assume its type as `double` by default. If you want more control, you can specify its type by suffixing it with any of these (they are case insensitive).

- **`f` or `F`** &mdash; to make it a `float`, e.g. `2.7f`
- **`l` or `L`** &mdash; to make it a `long double`, e.g. `4.8L`

### Formatting floating-point numbers

<NoteBox>
  Lospinoso suggests using <Code str="%g" /> to print floating-point numbers.
</NoteBox>

- **`%f`, `%lf`, or `%Lf`** &mdash; print normally (with trailing zeroes), e.g. `54321.000000` or `9.750000`
- **`%e`** &mdash; format-print the number in scientific notation, e.g. `6.02214e+23` or `9.750000e+00`
- **`%g`** &mdash; choose the shortest representation between `%f` (or `%lf`) and `%e`, removing the trailing zeroes, e.g. `6.02214e+23` or `9.75`

You can further format your number with additional flags/arguments in your `printf` format specifier. For example, printing `1.2555` with `%+08.2lf` will give you `+0001.26`:

- the `+` prefix flag &mdash; means always print the sign, i.e. `+` or `-`
- the `0` prefix flag &mdash; means left-pad the number with zeroes
- the `8` width argument &mdash; means the formatted number will take at least 8 characters
- the `.2` precision argument &mdash; means always display 2 digits after the decimal point (the default is 6)

## Character types

These store a single human language character, e.g. "A".

### Types of character types

- "Narrow characters":
  - **`char`** &mdash; May be signed or unsigned (depending on the compiler). It can store an ASCII character or a 1-byte integer.
- "Wide characters" (because they can store more than 1 byte):
  - **`char16_t`** &mdash; It can store a 2-byte character set, e.g. an UTF-16 character.
  - **`char32_t`** &mdash; It can store a 4-byte character set, e.g. an UTF-32 character.
  - **`wchar_t`** &mdash; May be 2 bytes or 4 bytes (depending on the compiler). It can store, for example, Unicode characters (2 bytes).

| Type            |     Size     | Min value |             Max value              |        F.S.         |
| --------------- | :----------: | :-------: | :--------------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| `char`          |    1 byte    |  &mdash;  |              &mdash;               |        `%c`         |
| `signed char`   |    1 byte    |   -128    |                127                 |        `%c`         |
| `unsigned char` |    1 byte    |     0     |                255                 |        `%c`         |
| `char16_t`      |   2 bytes    |     0     |               65,535               | <Asterisk str="*"/> |
| `char32_t`      |   4 bytes    |     0     | &approx; 4.29&times;10<sup>9</sup> | <Asterisk str="*"/> |
| `wchar_t`       | 2 or 4 bytes |  &mdash;  |              &mdash;               |        `%lc`        |

<Asterisk str="*">
  <Code str="char16_t" /> and <Code str="char32_t" /> don't exactly have a format specifier (you
  will need to convert them first if you want to print them). Alternatively, you can use{' '}
  <Code str="%#x" /> to print the character using their hexadecimal representation, e.g.{' '}
  <Code str="0x6c34" /> for <Code str="Ê∞¥" /> (The <Code str="#" /> flag adds the <Code str="0x" />{' '}
  prefix).
</Asterisk>

### Character literals

Quote them using single quotes (`'`), e.g. `'x'`.

If the type is not `char`, you must also give the following prefix:

- **`u`** &mdash; to make it `char16_t`, e.g. `u'x'`
- **`U`** &mdash; to make it `char32_t`, e.g. `U'x'`
- **`L`** &mdash; to make it `wchar_t`, e.g. `L'x'`

### Character escapes

To enter special characters:

- `\r` &mdash; to enter the carriage return character
- `\n` &mdash; to enter the newline character
- `\t` &mdash; to enter the tab character
- `\0` &mdash; to enter the null character
- `\'` &mdash; to enter the `'` character
- `\"` &mdash; to enter the `"` character
- `\\` &mdash; to enter the `\` character
- `\0` &mdash; to enter the null character

To enter Unicode characters:

- `\uXXXX` (4-digit Unicode code point) &mdash; e.g. `\u0041` to enter `A`
- `\UXXXXXXXX` (8-digit Unicode code point) &mdash; e.g. `\U0001F37A` to enter `üç∫`

## Boolean types

These store `true` or `false`.

### Types of boolean types

There is only a single boolean type: `bool`.

(Note that even though technically it only requires a single bit to store a true/false value, `bool` requires 1 byte.)

| Type   |  Size  | Min value | Max value |         F.S.         |
| ------ | :----: | :-------: | :-------: | :------------------: |
| `bool` | 1 byte |     0     |     1     | <Asterisk str="**"/> |

<Asterisk str="**">
  There are no format specifier for the <Code str="bool" /> type. Instead, you can use{' '}
  <Code str="%d" /> to print it as <Code str="0" /> oir <Code str="1" />.
</Asterisk>

### Boolean literals

Just write `true` or `false`.

Additionaly, the following shows the equivalence between boolean and integer types:

- `true` is equivalent to `1`
- `false` is equivalent to `0`
- Any non-zero integer value is equivalent to `true`
- Zero is equivalent to `false`

## Void types

The `void` type stores no value.

In fact, you cannot define a variable with a `void` type. You use `void` in "special situations," for example, to denote the return type of a function that doesn't return anything.

```cpp
void greet() {
  printf("Hello!\n");
}
```

## Other notable types

### `std::byte`

Defined in `<cstddef>` (`#include <cstddef>`), this type is usually used to handle _raw memory_ (collection of bits without a type).

### `size_t`

Defined in `<cstddef>` (`#include <cstddef>`), this type represents the size of an object in bytes. (Its actual type depends on the compiler, but you can think of it as an unsigned integer, usually `unsigned long long`.)

When you use the `typeof` operator, e.g. `sizeof(double)`, the return type would be `size_t`. Its format specifier is `%zu`.

```cpp
size_t size_double = sizeof(double);
printf("%zu\n", size_double);
//=> 8 (because double type requires 8 bytes)
```
