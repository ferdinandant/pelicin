# C-Style Strings

Strings are collections of characters, e.g. `"Hello, world!"`, traditionally represented by an array of `char`.

_C-style strings_ (aka. _null-terminated strings_) are arrays of `char` terminated by the null character (i.e. `\0` or ASCII code 0) at the end of the string.

For example, the way C-style string stores the string `"Hello"` is as follows. (Also note that because of the `\0`, the size of the `str[]` array would be 6 instead of 5.)

```cpp
char str[] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' };
```

## String literals

Quote them using double quotes (`"`), e.g. `"Hello"`. Note that you don't have to manually add the `\0` character (it's added automatically at the end.)

If the type is not array of `char`, don't forget to append them with the correct prefix:

- **`u`** &mdash; to make it an array of `char16_t` (UTF-16), e.g. `u"Hello"`
- **`U`** &mdash; to make it an array of `char32_t` (UTF-32), e.g. `U"Hello"`
- **`L`** &mdash; to make it an array of `wchar_t` (Unicode), e.g. `L"Hello"`

For example, the following demonstrates how you would store a string.

```cpp
// Stores "A book holds a house of gold."
char str_en[] = "A book holds a house of gold.";

// Stores "书中自有黄金屋"
char16_t str_zh[] = u"\u4e66\u4e2d\u81ea\u6709\u9ec4\u91d1\u5c4b";
```

## Concatenating string literals

You can concatenate a string literal directly after a string literal. (Whitespaces between string literals are ignored.)

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

char str[] =
  "Hello, "
  "You seem tired.";

int main() {
  printf("%s\n", str);
  //=> Hello, You seem tired.
}
```

## Formatting strings

### Narrow strings

The format specifier for arrays of `char` ("narrow strings") is `%s`.

```cpp
char name[] = "Ferdinand";
printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
```

### Wide strings

> "Printing Unicode to the console is surprisingly complicated."
> &mdash; Lospinoso

When dealing with Unicode characters (arrays of `char16_t`, `char32_t`, or `wchar_t`), you will have to ensure that the console supports it, and you have to set the correct [code page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page).

I tried making the snippet code (using wide strings), and sadly it didn't work.
