# Pointers

Pointers store the address of another object.

## Declaring a pointer

Append `*` after the type, e.g. `int*`:

```cpp
// my_ptr can store the address of an "int"
int* my_ptr;
```

## Formatting pointers

The format specifier for a pointer is `%p`.

```cpp
int* my_ptr;
printf("%p\n", my_ptr);
//=> 0x100015025 (could differ)
```

<NoteBox title="Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)">
  <p>
    To prevent hackers from targetting or implying certain address locations, addresses of
    executable codes and your variables are randomized.
  </p>
  <p>
    When something is accessed illegally (e.g. trying to execute data as executable codes), the
    program will crash, thus stopping the attack.
  </p>

## Pointer operators

### The address-of operator (&)

Prepend `&` before the variable's name to get its address.

```cpp
int* my_ptr;
int my_number = 5;

// Assign to my_ptr the address of my_number
my_ptr = &my_number;
```

### The dereference operator (\*)

Prepend `*` in front of the pointer's name to get the referenced object's value:

```cpp
int my_number = 5;
int* my_ptr = &my_number;

// Use *my_ptr to get the pointer's referenced value
printf("%p\n", my_ptr); //=> 0x7ffeefbff45c
printf("%d %d\n", my_number, *my_ptr); //=> 5 5

// You can also assign a new value directly
*my_ptr = 6;
printf("%p\n", my_ptr); //=> 0x7ffeefbff45c
printf("%d %d\n", my_number, *my_ptr); //=> 6 6
```

### The member-of operator (->)

Given a pointer, use the `->` operator to refer to the referenced object's member (a class' data or function):

```cpp
Date date;
Date* date_ptr = &date;

// This is the same as:
// (*date_ptr).print_date();
date_ptr->print_date();
```

## Pointers and arrays

### Pointer decay

When you try to assign an array into something else (including passing them as an argument to a function), the array will "decay" into a pointer.

What this means is that you **will only get the base address of the array** (which points to the first element of the array). You lose the information about the size of the array.

```cpp
struct User {
  char name[256];
};

void print_name(User* user_ptr) {
  // Note that pointer decay happens here, too.
  // You are passing `user_ptr->name` (which is a `char[]`)
  // into `printf`, so it decays into `char*`.
  printf("Hello, %s.\n", user_ptr->name);
}

int main() {
  User users[] = { "Alice", "Bob", "Eve" };
  print_name(users);
  //=> Hello, Alice.
}
```

### Using address-of operator (&) with arrays

Use `&array_name[i]` to get the address of the _i_-th element in `array_name`.

(Notice that it's the same as `&(array_name[i])`.)

```cpp
int arr[] = { 111, 222, 333 };

// This will yield the same result for first_element:
// int* first_element = arr (pointing to the base address)
int* first_element = &arr[0];
int* second_element = &arr[1];
printf("%d\n", *first_element); //=> 111
printf("%d\n", *second_element); //=> 222
```

### Using bracket operator ([]) with pointers to array

Use `array_ptr[i]` to get the _value_ of the _i_-th element in the referenced array.

```cpp
int numbers[] = { 444, 555, 666 };
int* numbers_ptr = numbers;

// The code below introduces the notion of pointer arithmetic,
// e.g. `*(numbers_ptr + 1)`. We will discuss them below.
printf("%d %d\n", numbers_ptr[0], *(numbers_ptr));
//=> 444 444
printf("%d %d\n", numbers_ptr[1], *(numbers_ptr + 1));
//=> 555 555
printf("%d %d\n", numbers_ptr[2], *(numbers_ptr + 2));
//=> 666 666
```

### Circumventing pointer decay

The common trick is to pass the length of the array as another argument.

```cpp
void print_names(User* users, size_t n_users) {
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n_users; i++) {
    printf("Hello, %s.\n", users[i].name);
  }
}

int main() {
  User users[] = { "Alice", "Bob", "Eve" };
  size_t n_users = sizeof(users) / sizeof(User);
  print_names(users, n_users);
  //=> Hello, Alice.
  //=> Hello, Bob.
  //=> Hello, Eve.
}
```

## Pointer arithmetic

You can use `+` or `-` operators on a pointer to access the next/previous element's address.

Under the hood, the compiler will figure out the correct byte offset depending on the pointer's referenced type. (For example, with `int* my_ptr`, doing `my_ptr + 1` will give you the address of `my_ptr` plus 4, because the size of `int` is 4 bytes.)

```cpp
int numbers[] = { 444, 555, 666 };

// Remember "pointer decay"
// (`numbers` will give you the base address of `numbers[]`)
int* numbers_ptr = numbers;

// `numbers_ptr` is the same as &(numbers_ptr[0])
int* first_number_ptr = numbers_ptr;
// `numbers_ptr + 1` is the same as &(numbers_ptr[1])
int* second_number_ptr = numbers_ptr + 1;
// `numbers_ptr + 2` is the same as &(numbers_ptr[2])
int* third_number_ptr = numbers_ptr + 2;

printf("%d %p\n", *first_number_ptr, first_number_ptr);
//=> 444 0x7ffeefbff44c
printf("%d %p\n", *second_number_ptr, second_number_ptr);
//=> 555 0x7ffeefbff450
printf("%d %p\n", *third_number_ptr, third_number_ptr);
//=> 666 0x7ffeefbff454
```

## `nullptr`

`nullptr` is a special literal value that means the pointer is not pointing to anything.

```cpp
int* my_ptr = nullptr;
printf("%p\n", numbers_ptr); //=> 0x0
```

Implicitly, `nullptr` is equivalent to `false`; any value other than `nullptr` is equivalent to `true`.

The common use case is to return `nullptr` (e.g. in a function that allocates memory) to indicate failure.

## `this`

In class method definitions, you implicitly have a `this` pointer that references the current class.

```cpp
struct Counter {
  int count = 0;
  void setCount(int count) {
    this->count = count;
  }
  void increment() {
    // or simply: `count++`
    this->count++;
  }
};
```

## Special pointer types

### `void*`

You can use `void*` pointers if you don't care with the referenced type. However,

- You cannot use dereferencing operator (\*) with `void*` pointers
- You cannot use pointer arithmetic with `void*` pointers

### `std::byte*`

You can use `std::byte*` pointers to handle raw bytes. (E.g. for copying raw data, enryption, compression.)
