# Classes and Structs

Classes are user-defined types that aggregate data and functions. When we _instantiate_ a class, we are creating an instance (or _member_) of that class.

- Example of a class: `Date`
- Example of a class instance: `today`, `bookingDate`

The "data" of a class are called _data members_ or _instance variables_. These usually represent the "properties" of the class. For example, a `Book` probably has a `title`, an `author`, etc. Each class members have their own data member values.

The "functions" of a class are called _member functions_ or _methods_. These are usually functions to obtain or manipulate the "data" of the class.

## Defining classes

### Use `struct` for plain-old data (POD) classes

Plain-old-data (POD) classes are classes that only contains "data" (no "functions").

POD classes are usually defined using `struct`. (You can also define functions inside `struct`, but you kind of break the convention.)

```cpp
struct Date {
  int day;
  int month;
  int year;
};

int main() {
  // Instantiate date
  Date today;
  // Set date data
  today.date = 1;
  today.month = 1;
  today.year = 2020;
}
```

### Use `class` for fully featured classes

When you need a class that has "data" and "functions," you can use `class`.

```cpp
class Counter {
 private:
  // You can initialize directly
  int count = 0;
 public:
  void setCount(int newCount) {
    count = newCount;
  }
  void increment() {
    count++;
  }
};

int main() {
  // Instantiate counter
  Counter counter;
  // Modify counter data
  counter.increment();
  counter.increment();
  printf("%d\n", counter.getCount()); //=> 2
}
```

## Access specifiers

Access specifiers specify who can access a class' data or functions. (This prevents external code from directly modifying internal data of a class.)

### Kinds of access specifier

- **`public`** &mdash; the class' data or functions can be accessed everywhere
- **`private`** &mdash; the class' data or functions can only be accessed (1) inside the class or (2) inside its friend classes
- **`protected`** &mdash; the class' data or functions can only be accessed (1) inside the class, (2) inside its friend classes, (3) inside its subclasses, or (4) inside its friend classes' subclasses

### Access specifier example

In the `Counter` class below,

- `count` is private
- `getCount()`, `setCount()`, and `increment()` are public

```cpp
class Counter {
 private:
  int count = 0;
 public:
  int getCount() {
    return count;
  }
  void increment() {
    count++;
  }
};
```

Trying to do the following will cause compilation error:

```cpp
Counter counter;
// ERROR: 'count' is a private member of 'Counter'
counter.count = 0;
```

### Default access specifier

- In a `struct`, the default access specifier is `private`
- In a `class`, the default access specifier is `public`

## Constructors

Constructors are functions that are called whenever an object is created (instantiated). You can use constructors to initialize data members of a class.

- You define a constructor using the name of the class, e.g. `MyClass()`.

- Constructors can take any number of arguments.

- You can have multiple constructors as long as their argument count and/or type differ.

- If you do not define any constructor, the compiler will implicitly define a public _default constructor_ for you (that does nothing)

```cpp
class Counter {
 private:
  int count;
 public:
  // Constructor 1
  Counter() {
    count = 0;
  }
  // Constructor 2
  Counter(int initCount) {
    count = initCount;
  }
  int getCount() {
    return count;
  }
  void increment() {
    count++;
  }
};

// This will call the argument that accepts nothing
Counter counter_a = {};
printf("%d\n", counter_a.getCount()); //=> 0

// This will call the argument that accepts one int
Counter counter_b = {5};
printf("%d\n", counter_b.getCount()); //=> 5
```

## Destructors

Destructors are functions that are called whenever an object is about to be destroyed. You can use destructors to do some cleanup logic.

You never manually call a destructor; they are called implicitly by the compiler (for example when you exit a function, and a reference to that class' intance is no longer required).

- You define a destructor using `~` plus the name of the class, e.g. `~MyClass()`.

- Destructor take no arguments.

- If you do not define any destructor, the compiler will implicitly define a _default destructor_ for you (that does nothing)

```cpp
struct MyClass {
  ~MyClass() {
    printf("Kaboom\n");
  }
}
```

## Constant members

Use the `const` keyword to prevent unintentional changes to your class' "data".

### Const data member

Marking a class "data" `const` means it cannot be changed past initialization.

```cpp
struct Scoring {
  const int passing_grade = 85;
};
```

### Const member function

Marking a class "function" `const` means it cannot modify the class' "data".

```cpp
class Counter {
  int count = 0;
 public:
  int getCount() const {
    // If you try to assign to `count` here,
    // you will get a compile error.
    return count;
  }
  void increment() {
    count++;
  }
};
```

## Static members

## Initialization

<NoteBox type="info">
  Whenever possible, initialize with braces (<Code str="{}" />
  ).
</NoteBox>

> "Part of the reason C++ initialization syntax is such a mess is that the language grew out of C, where object life cycles are primitive, into a language with a robust and featureful object life cycle."
> &mdash; Lospinoso

### If you didn't define a constructor

These call the default constructor (the constructor that does nothing):

```cpp
// These lines below mean the same
MyClass my_class;
MyClass my_class = {};
MyClass my_class {};
```

If all of the data members in your class is public (excluding member functions), these initialize them in order from top to bottom:

```cpp
struct MyClass {
 public:
  int a;
  bool b;
 private:
  void hello() {}
};

// These lines below mean the same
MyClass my_class = { 1, true };
MyClass my_class { 1, true };
```

### If you defined a constructor

These call the constructor that accepts no arguments:

```cpp
// These lines below mean the same
MyClass my_class;
MyClass my_class = {};
MyClass my_class {};
```

These call the corresponding constructor, given the type and order of the arguments:

```cpp
// These lines below mean the same
MyClass my_class = { 1, true };
MyClass my_class { 1, true };
```

Only if you pass more than one argument, you can also use parentheses (although it is not recommended). (If you pass no arguments, `MyClass()` is considered a function call to a yet-to-be-defined function, so it produces nothing.)

```cpp
MyClass my_class(1, true);
```

### With const data members

**If you specify no constructor:** use braced initialization, assuming and all data members in your class are public.

```cpp
struct ScoringScheme {
  const int passing_grade = 85;
};

ScoringScheme scheme_a = { 90 };
printf("%d\n", scheme_a.passing_grade);
//=> 90
```

**If you specify a constructor:** use _member initializer lists_ on the constructor.

```cpp
class Pair {
  const int a;
  const int b;
 public:
  // You can also use parenthesis, e.g.:
  // Pair(int init_a, int init_b) : a(init_a), b(init_b)
  Pair(int init_a, int init_b) : a{init_a}, b{init_b} {
    return;
  }
  void printValues() const {
    printf("(%d, %d)\n");
  }
};

Pair pair = { 1, 2 };
pair.printValues();
//=> (1, 2)
```
