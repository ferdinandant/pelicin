# Classes and Structs

Classes are user-defined types that aggregate data and functions. When we _instantiate_ a class, we are creating a _member_ of that class.

- Example of a class: `Date`
- Example of a class member: `today`, `bookingDate`

The "data" of a class are called _data members_ or _instance variables_. These usually represent the "properties" of the class. For example, a `Book` probably has a `title`, an `author`, etc. Each class members have their own data member values.

The "functions" of a class are called _member functions_ or _methods_. These are usually functions to obtain or manipulate the "data" of the class.

## Defining classes

### Use `struct` for plain-old data (POD) classes

Plain-old-data (POD) classes are classes that only contains "data" (no "functions").

POD classes are usually defined using `struct`. (You can also define functions inside `struct`, but you kind of break the convention.)

```cpp
struct Date {
  int day;
  int month;
  int year;
};

int main() {
  // Instantiate date
  Date today;
  // Set date data
  today.date = 1;
  today.month = 1;
  today.year = 2020;
}
```

### Use `class` for fully featured classes

When you need a class that has "data" and "functions," you can use `class`:

```cpp
class Counter {
  int count;
  int getCount() {
    return count;
  }
  void setCount(int newCount) {
    count = newCount;
  }
  void increment() {
    count++;
  }
};

int main() {
  // Instantiate counter
  Counter counter;
  // Modify counter data
  counter.setCount(0);
  counter.increment();
  counter.increment();
  printf("%d\n", counter.getCount()); //=> 2
}
```

## Access specifiers

Access specifiers specify who can access a class' data or functions. (This prevents external code from directly modifying internal data of a class.)

### Kinds of access specifier

- **`public`** &mdash; the class' data or functions can be accessed everywhere
- **`private`** &mdash; the class' data or functions can only be accessed (1) inside the class or (2) inside its friend classes
- **`protected`** &mdash; the class' data or functions can only be accessed (1) inside the class, (2) inside its friend classes, (3) inside its subclasses, or (4) inside its friend classes' subclasses

(We will defer the discussion about friend classes and subclasses further down below.)

### Default access specifier

- In a `class`, the
