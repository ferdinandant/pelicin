# Enumerations

Enumerations are types that only permit certain values. Under the hood, these "values" are just integers.

## Unscoped enumeration

To define an unscoped enumeration, use the `enum` keyword:

```cpp
enum Element {
  Fire,
  Water,
  Nature,
  Dark,
  Light,
};

Element monsterElement = Dark;
Element playerElement = Light;
```

<NoteBox type="warning">
  <p>
    Unscoped enumeration are "less safe" to use than scoped enumeration. They are supported in C++
    for historical reasons and interoperability with C.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Use scoped enumeration whenever possible.</strong>
  </p>
</NoteBox>

## Scoped enumeration

Scoped enumeration works like unscoped enumerations, except:

- you use `enum class` to define them, and
- you have to "scope" the values when you mention them

```cpp
enum class Element {
  Fire,
  Water,
  Nature,
  Dark,
  Light,
};

// You scope them using "Element::"
Element monsterElement = Element::Dark;
Element playerElement = Element::Light;
```
