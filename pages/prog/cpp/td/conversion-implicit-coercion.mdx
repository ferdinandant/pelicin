# Implicit Conversion (Coercion)

Implicit conversion (aka. type coercion) happens when C++ expects a value of one type, and you give a value of different type:

- If the value can be converted &mdash; _implicit conversion_ occurs.
- If the value cannot be converted &mdash; compile error occurs.

Note that type conversion produces a new value of the desired type and DOES NOT change the value or type of the object being converted (learncpp.com).

## Numeric promotions

Numeric promotion converts a smaller data type to a larger data type (e.g. `float` to `double`), **but the rule is only applied to certain data types**. (For other data types that are not covered by numeric promotion, see numeric conversion below.)

Numeric promotions are guaranteed to preserve the value before and after promotion.

### Integral promotions

- `signed char` and `signed short` &mdash; can be converted to `int`
- `unsigned char` and `unsigned short` &mdash; can be converted to `int` OR `unsigned int` (depending on whether the architecture's `int` can hold the entire range of the original type)
- `bool` &mdash; can be converted to `int` (false becomes 0, true becomes 1)

### Floating-point promotions

- `float` &mdash; can be converted to `double`

## Numeric conversions

Numeric conversion works like numeric promotion, but applies to a wider range of data types. (The distinction between numeric _promotion_ and _conversion_ is "mostly academic," but matters in [function overload resolution](#TODO), learncpp.com.)

- an integer type &mdash; can be converted to any other integer types (e.g. `int` to `short`, or `int` to `long`)
- a floating-point type &mdash; can be converted to any other floating-point types (e.g. `double` to `float`, or `double` to `long double`)
- an integer type &mdash; can be converted to any floating-point types (e.g. `int` to `double`)
- a floating-point type &mdash; can be converted to any integer types (e.g. `double` to `int`)
- an integer type or a floating-point type &mdash; can be converted to `bool` (non-zero value becomes true, zero value becomes false)

### Narrowing conversions

Note that conversions from "larger" or "more precise" data types to "smaller" or "less precise" data types are called _narrowing conversions_.

You may lose data/precision in this case. For example, when you store a `double` value `3.123` to an `int`, you will get `3`.

## Arithmetic conversions

Operations with most binary operators (e.g. `+`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `&&`) normally require that the operands' types to be the same.

If the types are not the same, then the operand with the "lower priority" is converted to match the type of the operand with the "higher priority" (e.g. operating an `int` with a `double` will produce a `double` value):

- `long double` (highest)
- `double`
- `float`
- `unsigned long long`
- `long long`
- `unsigned long`
- `long`
- `unsigned int`
- `int` (lowest)

## Pointer conversions

- pointer to a subclass &mdash; can be converted as pointer to its superclass ("upcasting")
- pointer to any type &mdash; can be converted as pointer with type `void*`
- pointer with type `void*` &mdash; can be converted as pointer to any type (with [explicit cast](/prog/cpp/td/conversion-explicit-casting))
- zero integer expression &mdash; can be converted as the null pointer

## Reference conversions

- reference to a subclass — can be converted as reference to its superclass ("upcasting")
