# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

<NoteBox>Cross-origin refer to URI with different protocol, host, OR port.</NoteBox>

For security reasons, browsers block cross-origin HTTP requests from scripts. To allow this, the cross-origin server being hit must send `Cross-Origin-Allow-Origin` response header.

## How it works

In general, the browser will send a "preflight" OPTION request to the origin server, and upon the cross-origin server's approval, proceeds to send the actual request.

There are, however, requests that are considered "simple requests" that do not require sending the preflight request (see: [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests)).

### Simple request CORS flow

The browser simply sends the actual request without a preflight request.

/>

### Preflighted request CORS flow

The browser sends a preflight request before sending the actual request. Note the use of the following request headers:

- `Access-Control-Request-Method` (specifying the HTTP request method)
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers` (specifiying list of request headers in the actual request)

## Sending credentials with CORS

By default, for cross-origin requests, the browser will not send credentials (e.g. cookies and HTTP Authentication information).

If you want to send credentials, you have to set a special flag on the `XMLHttpRequest` object or the `Request` constructor (such as the `withCredentials` property below).

```js
// Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
const invocation = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url = 'http://bar.other/resources/credentialed-content/';

function callOtherDomain() {
  if (invocation) {
    invocation.open('GET', url, true);
    invocation.withCredentials = true; // <-
    invocation.onreadystatechange = handler;
    invocation.send();
  }
}
```

**Expected server response:** For the request to be successful AND for the response to be given to JavaScript, the cross-origin server _must_ send the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` response header, AND the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header _must not_ be `*`.

Note that third-party cookie policies (e.g. [`SameSite`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite) cookie attribute or third-party cookie browser settings) will still apply.

## Relevant response headers

### `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

Enables CORS on the specified origin (or any origin if `*` is given).

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

**Dynamic origin:** You can only specify a single origin. If the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` value changes dynamically based on the request origin, you should also include `Vary: Origin` response header.

### `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`

**For a preflight request:** indicates if the actual request can be made using credentials. (If omitted, it will fail and the response would not be given to JavaScript.)

**For an actual request:** tells the browser whether to expose the response to JavaScript.

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`

Lists allowed HTTP methods on the resource (URI).

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: <method>, <method>, ...
```

### `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`

Indicates which HTTP headers can be used when making the actual request.

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: <header-name>, <header-name>, ...
```

### `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`

Allows JavaScript to read the given response headers. (Only [CORS-safelisted response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS-safelisted_response_header) are exposed by default.)

```http
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: <header-name>, <header-name>, ...
```

### `Access-Control-Max-Age`

Indicates how long (in seconds) response to a preflight request can be cached. (Referring to the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response headers).

E.g. `Access-Control-Max-Age: 600`.

```http
Access-Control-Max-Age: <delta-seconds>
```

## Relevant request headers

### `Origin`

Marks from which URI the request was sent (it can be null).

### `Access-Control-Request-Method`

In the preflight request: specifies which HTTP method is to be used in the actual request (e.g. `POST`).

### `Access-Control-Request-Headers`

In the preflight request: specifies which request headers are to be included in the actual request.

The server "response" would be on the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header.

```http
Access-Control-Request-Headers: <header-name>, <header-name>, ...
```
