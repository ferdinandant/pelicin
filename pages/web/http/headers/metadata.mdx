# Metadata

<NoteBox type="info">
  You may also be interested to see <Code str="Content-*" /> response headers in{' '}
  <Link str="content negotiation" link="/web/http/negotiation-headers/content-negotiation" />,
</NoteBox>

These headers give metadata about the client, the server, or the document not classified elsewhere.

## Response headers

### `Content-Length`

Length of resource in bytes.

```http
Content-Length: <length>
```

### `Content-Disposition`

Indicates if the content is expected to be displayed _inline_ in the browser (as a Web page or as part of a Web page), or as an _attachment_ (downloaded and saved locally).

A <Code str="multipart/form-data" /> body requires a <Code str="Content-Disposition" /> header to provide information for each subpart of the form. In this case, the first directive is always `form-data`, followed by the `name` of the field, and optionally followed by additional directives.

```http
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Disposition: attachment
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="filename.jpg"
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fieldName"
```

### `Date`

Indicates the date and time at which the HTTP message originated.

```http
Date: <day-name>, <day> <month> <year> <hour>:<minute>:<second> GMT
```

### `Server`

Describes the software used by the origin server that handled the request. (Should be avoided because this makes it easier to look for known vulnerabilities.)

```http
Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)
```

## Request headers

### `Host`

Indicates the host (and port number) of the server to which the request is being sent, e.g. `Host: pelicin.netlify.app`

```http
Host: <host>:<port>
```

### `User-Agent`

Used to identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the client ("what browser the client uses").
In reality, [user agent string is a mess](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/).

```http
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (<system-information>) <platform> (<platform-details>) <extensions>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
```
