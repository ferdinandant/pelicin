# Content Negotiation

With content negotiation, a server can serve different representations ("formats") of a resource at the same URI (MDN).

The client can tell the server which representation it supports/prefers via `Accept-*` request headers. The server indicates which representation it sent via `Content-*` response headers. (In some cases, the role is reversed.)

You can also use this for compression (e.g. `Accept-Encoding: gzip`).

## Terminologies

### Quality value

In some of the directives below, you may attach a "quality value" (`;q=`) from 0 up to 1. It's basically the priority of that item, the default being 1.

Also, if they have the same quality value, more specific items (like `text/html`) will have more priority over the less specific ones (like `text/*` or `*/*`).

```http
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, */*;q=0.8
```

### Client Hints (CH)

<NoteBox type="warning">Currently, this is experimental.</NoteBox>

Client Hints are request headers sent by the client to give information about the device, network, user, and the user agent.

These headers include:

- **`Device-Memory`** &mdash; amount of available memory in GB (rounded to a power of 2)
- **`Save-Data`** &mdash; indicates preference to save/reduce data transfer
- **`Downlink`** &mdash; approximate bandwidth of the client's connection to the server in Mbps
- **`ECT`** &mdash; effective connection type; one of `slow-2g`, `2g`, `3g`, `4g`
- **`RTT`** &mdash; approximate round-trip time on the application layer, in ms

## Response headers

### `Content-Type`

Indicates the _original_ MIME type of the resource sent by the server (prior to any content encoding). This is the server's reply to the `Accept` request header.

Browsers may ignore this value and detect the MIME type themselves (see [`X-Content-Type-Options`](#x-content-type-options) to disable this behavior).

```http
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=<boundary_string>
```

### `Content-Encoding`

Lists any encoding(s) that have been applied (usually compression algorithms). This is the server's reply to the `Accept-Encoding` request header.

```http
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Encoding: compress
Content-Encoding: deflate
Content-Encoding: br
```

### `Content-Language`

Describes the language(s) of the intended audience. This is the server's reply to the `Accept-Language` request header.

This may not be the language of the document itself (e.g. `Content-Language: de-DE` may be written in English if it's a language course page for German speakers). For that, use `lang` attribute instead.

```http
Content-Language: en-US
Content-Language: de-DE
Content-Language: de-DE, en-CA
```

### `Accept-Post`

Advertises which MIME types are accepted for HTTP POST requests.

```http
Accept-Post: application/example, text/example
Accept-Post: image/webp
Accept-Post: */*
```

### `Accept-Patch`

Advertises which MIME types are accepted for HTTP PATCH requests.

```http
Accept-Patch: application/example, text/example
Accept-Patch: text/example;charset=utf-8
Accept-Patch: application/merge-patch+json
```

### `Accept-CH`

Indicates which [client hint](<http://localhost:3000/web/http/negotiation-headers/content-negotiation#client-hints-(ch)>) header(s) a client should include in subsequent requests.

(If a client hint header determines which representation is sent, you should also include it in the `Vary` header to ensure correct caching behavior.)

```http
Accept-CH: Viewport-Width, Width
```

### `X-Content-Type-Options`

Sometimes, browsers may do "MIME-type sniffing" (deducing a content's MIME type themselves by looking at the content). To prevent this behavior, you can specify `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

## Request headers

### `Accept`

Lists the MIME types the client understands.

You can also give "quality values" to denote priorities in the list, e.g. `Accept: text/html, application/xml;q=0.9`.

```http
Accept: <MIME_type>/<MIME_subtype>
Accept: <MIME_type>/*
Accept: */*
```

### `Accept-Encoding`

Lists which content encoding (usually compression algorithms) the client understands.

You can also give "quality values" to denote priorities in the list, e.g. `Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip;q=1.0, *;q=0.5`.

```http
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Encoding: compress
Accept-Encoding: deflate
Accept-Encoding: br
Accept-Encoding: identity
Accept-Encoding: *
```

### `Accept-Language`

Lists which language the client understands.

You can also give "quality values" to denote priorities in the list, e.g. `Accept-Language: fr-CH, fr;q=0.9, en;q=0.8`

```http
Accept-Language: <language>
Accept-Language: *
```
