# Caching

Caching means storing a given response so it can be served back immediately when requested. Caching improves performance (reduces network transmission) and eases the load of the origin server.

## Types of caches

There are two types of cache:

- **Shared proxy caches** &mdash; cache for multiple users ("shared cache")
- **Private browser caches** &mdash; cache for only a single user ("private/local cache")

Reading from the response headers, they will determine what responses should be cached, and how (e.g. how long, how to revalidate for freshness).

## Cache validation

Once a cached resource goes past its expiration time (determined by the `max-age` directive or `Expire` response header), when its value is about to be used again (e.g. when the user presses the reload button), it must either be:

- validated (rechecked by the origin server that the cached copy is still valid), or
- fetched again (e.g. if the resource has changed).

### How it works

Validation can only occur if the server provided either a strong validator (`ETag`) or a weak validator (`Last-Modified`) in the response header.

When the client asks for a resource by including the `If-None-Match` (if the resource is using Etag) or the `If-Modified-Since` request header, the server may respond with:

- **200 (OK)** &mdash; indicating the client should use this newly sent response
- **304 (Not Modified)** &mdash; (with an empty body, optionally including headers that update the expiration time of the cached resource) indicating the client should use its cached copy

## Response headers

### `Cache-Control`

Controls caching behavior. Multiple directives should be separated by comma.

"Revalidation for freshness" here is done by the client sending
(via `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since` request header)

<Badge color="blue">Cachability directives</Badge>

- **`no-store`** &mdash; don't store response in any cache
- **`no-cache`** &mdash; the response can be stored in any cache, but it must _always_ be revalidated for freshness by the origin server before its value can be used.
- **`public`** &mdash; the response can be stored in any cache
- **`private`** &mdash; the response can be stored only in a browser's cache

<Badge color="blue">Expiration directives</Badge>

- **`max-age=<seconds>`** &mdash; how long the resource should be considered fresh (relative to the time of request)
- **`s-maxage=<seconds>`** &mdash; overrides `max-age`, but only for shared caches (private caches will ignore it)

<Badge color="blue">Revalidation directives</Badge>

- **`must-revalidate`** &mdash; local copy can be used if it's younger than `max-age`; otherwise it must first be revalidated for freshness by the origin server. The origin server can respond

```http
Cache-Control: no-store
Cache-Control: no-cache
Cache-Control: public
Cache-Control: private
Cache-Control: max-age=<seconds>
Cache-Control: s-maxage=<seconds>
Cache-Control: must-revalidate
Cache-Control: proxy-revalidate
Cache-Control: no-transform
```

### `ETag`

Indicates the version of a resource. You can use the content hash, last modified timestamp, or a revision number.

If this response header is present, the client will send `If-None-Match` on future requests of the resource to validate the cached resource.

You can use "strong" or "weak" ETag value:

- **Strong Etag** (e.g. `ETag: "1f2b3d"`) &mdash; If two strong ETags match, it means the resource is byte-for-byte identical. (It can be cached for [byte range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Ranges).)
- **Weak Etag** (e.g. `ETag: W/"1f2b3d"`) &mdash; If two weak ETags match, it means the resource is semantically equivalent, but not necessarily byte-for-byte identical (e.g. different date of generation in the footer). (It cannot be cached for [byte range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Ranges).)

```http
ETag: "<etag_value>"
ETag: W/"<etag_value>"
```

### `Last-Modified`

Indicates the time at which the resource was last modified, e.g. `Last-Modified: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT` (it's precise up to seconds, and always in GMT).

If this response header is present, the client will send `If-Modified-Since` on future requests of the resource to validate the cached resource.

```http
Last-Modified: <day-name>, <day> <month> <year> <hour>:<minute>:<second> GMT
```

### `Age`

Indicates the time in seconds the resource has been in a proxy cache.

```http
Age: <delta-seconds>
```

### `Expires`

Indicates the time after which the response is considered stale.

(If there is a `Cache-Control` response header with the `max-age` or `s-maxage` directive, this header is ignored.)

```http
Expires: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
```

### `Vary`

Indicates the response should be considered unique if any request/response header listed on `Vary` differs in value.

Any cache should remember the combination of header values listed on `Vary`, and should only give the cached resource copy if all header values match. Otherwise, a fresh response must be requested from the origin server.

Using `Vary: *` means each requests should be treated unique and should not be cached. (Consider using `Cache-Control: no-store` instead.)

Since `Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate`, `Accept-Encoding: gzip` are considered different, to avoid unnecessary requests and duplicated cache entries, caching servers should consider [normalization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#normalization) (i.e. preprocessing the request by normalizing/rewriting the value of the request headers).

```http
Vary: *
Vary: <header-name>, <header-name>, ...
```

## Request headers

### `Cache-Control`

Requests caching behavior. Multiple directives should be separated by comma.

TODO
https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html#header.cache-control

<Badge color="blue">Cachability directives</Badge>

- **`no-store`** &mdash; don't store the request/response in any cache
- **`no-cache`** &mdash; don't use any cached response, unless it has been revalidated for freshness by the origin server
- **`no-transform`** &mdash; don't let any intermediary servers transform the response (e.g. to compress the images)
- **`only-if-cached`** &mdash; only send cached response, otherwise send a 504 (Gateway Timeout) response

<Badge color="blue">Expiration directives</Badge>

- **`max-age=<seconds>`** &mdash; asks for response whose age is not greater than the given number of seconds
- **`max-stale=<seconds>`** &mdash; it's acceptable to give stale response (exceeded its freshness lifetime), as long as it hasn't been stale for more than the given number of seconds
- **`min-fresh=<seconds>`** &mdash; asks for response which would still be fresh for the given number of seconds (the freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds)

```http
Cache-Control: no-store
Cache-Control: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-transform
Cache-Control: only-if-cached
Cache-Control: max-age=<seconds>
Cache-Control: max-stale[=<seconds>]
Cache-Control: min-fresh=<seconds>
```

### `If-None-Match`

Requests the server to only send a full 200 (OK) response if it doesn't have an `ETag` matching the given ones. Otherwise, the server will send 304 (Not Modified) response with an empty body.

- **`<etag-value>`** &mdash; may be prefixed with `W/` to indicate weak etag.
- **`*`** &mdash; a special value to represent any resource (e.g. used with PUT to check if the same resource has been uploaded before)

```http
If-None-Match: "<etag-value>"
If-None-Match: "<etag-value>", "<etag-value>", ...
If-None-Match: *
```

### `If-Modified-Since`

Requests the server to only send a full 200 (OK) response if the resource has been last modified after the given time. Otherwise, the server will send 304 (Not Modified) response with an empty body.

Used in conjuction with `Last-Modified` response header. Ignored if `If-None-Match` is also present.

```http
If-Modified-Since: <day-name>, <day> <month> <year> <hour>:<minute>:<second> GMT
```
