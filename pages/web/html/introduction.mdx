HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language that describes the structure of a web page.

## HTML Elements

HTML is made up of elements.

An element typically consists of an <dfn>opening tag</dfn> (which may specify attributes and their values), <dfn>content</dfn>, and a <dfn>closing tag</dfn>. Some elements do not have content and a closing tag.

## HTML Comments

Anything between `<!--` and `-->` are comments. They don't do anything. Developers typically use them to put notes/separators.

```html
<!--
  I am a comment.
  I can span multiple lines!
-->
```

## Structure of HTML Documents

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata goes here -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` signifies that the document is using HTML5 (the latest standard)

- `<html>` is the root element &mdash; it's always there encompassing everything

- `<head>` is where you place metadata of the page (e.g. title, SEO metadata, etc.)

- `<body>` is where you place the content of your page.
