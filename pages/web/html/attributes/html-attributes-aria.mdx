# ARIA HTML Attributes

<NoteBox type="info">
  <p>
    ARIA was created based on HTML4 specification. Many of the "widgets" defined in ARIA were later
    incorporated into HTML5.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      For such elements where the semantically correct HTML5 elements exists, developers should use
      them over AIRA.

<dfn>ARIA</dfn> (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of attributes intended to make web content
and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

## Types of ARIA attributes

The ARIA specification is split up into three different types of attributes:

- Role attributes &mdash; describe widgets that aren't otherwise available in HTML4 (e.g. sliders, menu bars, tabs, and dialogs)
- Property attributes &mdash; describe characteristics of these widgets (e.g. if they are draggable, have a required element, or have a popup associated with them)
- State attributes &mdash; describe the current interaction state of an element (e.g. busy, disabled, selected, or hidden).

## Using ARIA

Just use `role=[...]` from any of the non-italicized class name below. (Right-click and select "View Image" to see the image larger.)

The italicized class names are called <dfn>abstract roles</dfn>; they are the base classes from which state attributes and property attributes can be inherited. They should not appear on your HTML.

Here's an example from MDN.

```html
<!-- Now *these* are Tabs! -->
<!-- We've added role attributes to describe the tab list and each tab. -->
<ol role="tablist">
  <li id="ch1Tab" role="tab">
    <a href="#ch1Panel">Chapter 1</a>
  </li>
  <li id="ch2Tab" role="tab">
    <a href="#ch2Panel">Chapter 2</a>
  </li>
  <li id="quizTab" role="tab">
    <a href="#quizPanel">Quiz</a>
  </li>
</ol>

<div>
  <!-- Notice the role and aria-labelledby attributes we've added to describe these panels. -->
  <div id="ch1Panel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ch1Tab">Chapter 1 content goes here</div>
  <div id="ch2Panel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ch2Tab">Chapter 2 content goes here</div>
  <div id="quizPanel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="quizTab">Quiz content goes here</div>
</div>
```

For more information on what each role/property/state attribute means, you can consult [this
resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2). Just search for:

- <strong>
    <code>[roleName] (role)</code>
  </strong> (e.g. <code>tab (role)</code>) &mdash; to look for the description for the role, as well
  as state and property attributes in can take

- <strong>
    <code>[name] (property)</code>
  </strong> (e.g. <code>aria-labelledby (role)</code>) &mdash; to look for the description on a
  property attribute

- <strong>
    <code>[name] (state)</code>
  </strong> (e.g. <code>aria-current (state)</code>) &mdash; to look for the description on a state
  attribute
