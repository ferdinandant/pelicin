# Pods

A pod is a group of co-located containers (they run in one worker node).

Each pod can communicate to one another using the pod's IP.

## Sharing of Linux namespaces

The containers in a pod run in the same Linux namespace(s), i.e.,

- **They share the same network and UTS namespaces** &mdash; They share the same hostname and network interfaces (i.e., they share the same IP and port space). They can communicate to each other using the loopback network interface (localhost). Also, be careful not to have different processes bind to the same port.
- **They share the same IPC namespace** &mdash; They can communicate through IPC.
- **BUT they don't share the same PID namespace by default** &mdash; unless you enable this, each container will only see their own processes when you run `ps aux` inside them

## Pod descriptor

A sample pod [descriptor](devops/kubernetes/concepts/getting-started/yaml-descriptor) looks like the following:

```yaml
# uses the v1 version of the Kubernetes API
apiVersion: v1

# it's a pod
kind: Pod

metadata:
  # name of the pod
  name: kubia-manual
  # key-value pair for organization
  # otherwise your cluster will look like a mess
  label:
    appName: kubia-app
    version: 1.0.0]

spec:
  containers:
    - # the image used
      image: kubia
      # name of the pod
      name: kubia
      # use local image (don't pull from registry)
      imagePullPolicy: Never
      # for documentation only (listing ports are optional)
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

## Working with pods

<NoteBox type="info">
  Pod's abbreviation is <Code str="po" />. (You can type <Code str="po" /> or <Code str="pod" /> in
  your command.)
</NoteBox>

### Creating a new pod

Send the pod descriptor to the Kubernetes API server:

```bash
# If you create a descriptor named kubia-manual.yaml:
kubectl create -f kubia-manual.yaml
```

### Stopping and deleting a pod

You can also use `-l <selector>` to filter by [selectors](/devops/kubernetes/concepts/getting-started/labels-selectors):

```bash
kubectl delete po kubia-manual
```

### Stopping and deleting all pods

Delete all pod in the current namespace as follows:

```bash
kubectl delete po --all
```

If you delete the namespace, all the pods running in there will also be deleted:

```bash
# kubectl delete namespace <namespace>
kubectl delete namespace custom-namespace
```
