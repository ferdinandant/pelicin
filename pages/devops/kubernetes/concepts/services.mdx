# Services

Pods can be moved accross nodes (thus assigned a different IP), or even replicated (the set of pods' IPs at one time may be different to another).

A _service_ solves this issue by **exposing multiple pods at a single constant IP and port pair** (Lukša). Instead of connecting to the pods directly, you should connect to the service using its static IP.
