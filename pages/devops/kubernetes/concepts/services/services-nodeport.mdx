# NodePort Services

A NodePort service allows you to expose a service (externally) by **opening a specific port on every node in the cluster**.

Any requests made through the node will be routed to the service, even if the node doesn't handle the service.

      A NodePort service opens a specific port on all nodes. Traffic to the <Code str="nodePort" />{' '}
      (30123) will be routed to the <Code str="targetPort" /> (8080) of the pods that handle the
      service.

## NodePort service descriptor

Mention the service's `selector`, and the `ports` mapping.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubia-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  # pods that handle the service have these labels
  selector:
    app: kubia
  ports:
    - # connect here if you use the service's internal IP
      port: 80
      # connect here if you use a cluster node's IP
      nodePort: 30123
      # traffics will be routed here
      targetPort: 8080
```

## Connecting to a NodePort service

<NoteBox type="warning">
  Ensure that you have allowed external connections to your nodes on the specified port.
</NoteBox>

When you list your NodePort service,

```bash
kubectl get svc kubia-nodeport
# NAME             CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
# kubia-nodeport   10.111.254.223   <nodes>       80:30123/TCP   2m
```

Observe that:

- **The `EXTERNAL-IP` column** &mdash; lists `<nodes>`, which means you can connect to the service using any of the cluster node's IP
- **The `PORT(S)` column** &mdash; lists the "internal port" and the "node port":
  - internal port 80, if you want to connect from the service's cluster-internal IP (in this case, 10.111.254.223)
  - node port 30123, if you want to connect from the cluster node's IP

---

This means that you can connect to your service through:

- `10.111.254.223` port 80
- `<1st node's IP>` port 30123
- `<2nd node's IP>` port 30123
- and so on
