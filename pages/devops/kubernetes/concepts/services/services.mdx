# Services

Pods can be moved accross nodes (thus assigned a different IP), or even replicated (the set of pods' IPs at one time may be different to another).

A _service_ solves this issue by **exposing multiple pods at a single constant IP-and-port pair** (Lukša). Instead of connecting to the pods directly, you should connect to the service using its static IP.

<Image
  path="/res/devops/kubernetes/service-label.jpg"
  caption={<>A service knows which pods handle the service through the use of labels.</>}
  sourceString={'Lukša'}

## Service descriptor

Mention `selector` (pod label selector, i.e., which pods handle the service) AND `ports` (ports mapping):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubia
spec:
  selector:
    app: kubia
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

### Without selectors

You can create a Service descriptor without the `selector` field, but you will need to manage your own [Endpoints](#TODO).

### Using named ports

You can target named ports in your pod's descriptor.

If those port number changes, you don't need to change the references to those ports which use the ports' name.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: kubia
      ports:
        # here's a pod named http in the container
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
        # here's a pod named https in the container
        - name: https
          containerPort: 8443
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
spec:
  ports:
    # target the pods' "http" port
    - name: service-http-port
      port: 80
      targetPort: http
    # target the pods' "https" port
    - name: service-https-port
      port: 443
      targetPort: https
```

## Discovering services

For pods to connect to a service, **you don't always need to create the service first and then manually look up its IP and port.**

Kubernetes provides some methods for service discovery.

### Through environment variables

When a pod is started, all preexisting services' ports and IPs are exposed through environment variables.

The services' names will be converted to `SNAKE_CASE`. If your service's name is `xxx`, you will see these environment variables:

- `XXX_SERVICE_HOST` &mdash; telling you the service's host
- `XXX_SERVICE_PORT` &mdash; telling you the service's port

```bash
kubectl exec kubia-3inly env
# PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# HOSTNAME=kubia-3inly
# KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=10.111.240.1
# KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443
# ...
# KUBIA_SERVICE_HOST=10.111.249.153
# KUBIA_SERVICE_PORT=80
# ...
```

### Through DNS (only for the IP)

When you list pods in the `kube-system` namespace, you will see a Kubernetes DNS pod, named either:

- `kube-dns-<something>` for Kube-DNS, or
- `coredns-<something>` for Core DNS.

You can perform a DNS query (in the form of fully qualified domain name, aka FQDN) to get a service's IP address (you still need to know the port yourself).

#### Example

Using DNS resolution allows you to do stuff like this (note that you don't need to know the IP of the `kubia` service in the pod's SSH session):

```bash
kubectl exec -it kubia-3inly -- bash
# root@kubia-3inly:/# curl http://kubia.default.svc.cluster.local
# You've hit kubia-5asi2
```

#### Service FQDN format

A sample FQDN is as follows (you can configure the `.cluster.local` suffix if you want):

```bash
# <serviceName>.<serviceNamespaceName>.svc.cluster.local
backend-database.default.svc.cluster.local
```

#### Configuring DNS lookup behavior

Kubernetes sets the default DNS lookup behavior in each container by writing a `/etc/resolv.conf` file (e.g., it sets the IP of the DNS server).

You can modify this behavior by changing the [`resolv.conf`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/resolv.conf.5.html) file yourself. For example, setting the `search` field will allow you to automatically expand queries like `data` to `data.test.svc.cluster.local`:

```ini
# /etc/resolv.conf
# 'data' queries can be expanded to 'data.test.svc.cluster.local', etc.
# see https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/resolv.conf.5.html
nameserver 10.32.0.10
search test.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local
options ndots:5
```

#### Excluding pods for DNS query

Set the `dnsPolicy` field in each pod's spec.

## Working with services

<NoteBox type="info">
  Service's abbreviation is <Code str="svc" />. (You can type <Code str="service" /> or{' '}
  <Code str="svc" /> in your command.)
</NoteBox>

### Creating a Service

You can use a descriptor file:

```bash
kubectl create -f <filename>
```

Or the `kubectl expose` command:

```bash
kubectl expose pod <podName> --type=LoadBalancer --name <serviceName>
```

### Listing Services

```bash
kubectl get svc
# NAME         CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
# kubernetes   10.111.240.1     <none>        443/TCP   30d
# kubia        10.111.249.153   <none>        80/TCP    6m
```

### Describing a Service

```bash
kubectl describe svc <serviceName>
```
