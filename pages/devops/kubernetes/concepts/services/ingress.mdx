# Ingress

An Ingress allows you to expose multiple services under a single public IP (and load balancer).

An Ingress works on the application layer, so you can do path-based routing, cookie-based session affinity, etc., which Services can't.

## Ingress controller

To make ingress resources work, an Ingress controller needs to be running in the cluster.

Different Kubernetes environments use [different implementation of the Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/#additional-controllers), and some may not provide a default controller at all.

### Enablic Ingress controller in Minikube

Check if the Ingress add-on is enabled:

```bash
minikube addons list
# - default-storageclass: enabled
# - kube-dns: enabled
# - heapster: disabled
# - ingress: disabled # <--
# - registry-creds: disabled
# - addon-manager: enabled
# - dashboard: enabled
```

If it's not enabled, enable the Ingress add-on:

```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
# ingress was successfully enabled
```

Enabling the Ingress add-on will start the Ingress controller pod, most likely running in the `kube-system` namespace. In the following example, you see that Nginx is used to provide the Ingress functionality.

```bash
kubectl get po --all-namespaces
# NAMESPACE    NAME                            READY  STATUS    RESTARTS AGE
# default      kubia-rsv5m                     1/1    Running   0        13h
# default      kubia-fe4ad                     1/1    Running   0        13h
# default      kubia-ke823                     1/1    Running   0        13h
# kube-system  default-http-backend-5wb0h      1/1    Running   0        18m
# kube-system  kube-addon-manager-minikube     1/1    Running   3        6d
# kube-system  kube-dns-v20-101vq              3/3    Running   9        6d
# kube-system  kubernetes-dashboard-jxd9l      1/1    Running   3        6d
# kube-system  nginx-ingress-controller-gdts0  1/1    Running   0        18m
```

## Ingress descriptor

With the Ingress controller running, you can now crate an Ingress resource.

Specify the routing `rules` (the host and list of paths):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-wildcard-host
spec:
  rules:
    # You can also use wildcards for the host
    # e.g. "host: '*.foo.com'"
    - host: 'foo.bar.com'
      http:
        paths:
          # This match all incoming requests
          # (because it matches by the '/' prefix)
          - pathType: Prefix
            path: '/'
            backend:
              service:
                name: service1
                port:
                  number: 80
```

### Path spec

A `pathType` can be:

- **`ImplementationSpecific`** &mdash; matching is up to the IngressClass
- **`Exact`** &mdash; case sensitive match exactly (also needs to match the trailing slash)
- **`Prefix`** &mdash; case sensitive match by path segment prefix (split by `/`), also ignores trailing slashes

```yaml
# Under .spec.rules[i].http
paths:
  - pathType: Prefix
    path: '/foo'
    backend:
      service:
        name: service2
        port:
          number: 80
  - path: /icons
    pathType: ImplementationSpecific
    backend:
      resource:
        apiGroup: k8s.example.com
        kind: StorageBucket
        name: icon-assets
```

## Accessing the service through the Ingress

Get the address of the ingress

```bash
kubectl get ingresses
# NAME      HOSTS               ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE
# kubia     kubia.example.com   192.168.99.100   80        29m
```

Configure your DNS to resolve the ingress host to the ingress' IP (edit `/etc/hosts` if you're developing locally):

```
192.168.99.100    kubia.example.com
```

Access the ingress:

```bash
curl http://kubia.example.com
# You've hit kubia-ke823
```

### How it works

The IP you obtained earlier (the one you set in the DNS) is the IP of the Ingress controller.

Using the incoming request's `Host` header and path, the Ingress controller determine (1) which service to hit, and (2) which pod IPs can the request be forwarded to (by looking at the service's Endpoints).

The Ingress controller then forward the request to the service's pod. (It doesn't forward the request to the Service itself. It only uses the Service info to select a pod.)
