# LoadBalancer Services

<NoteBox type="info">
  <strong>If your environment does not support LoadBalancer services:</strong> no load balancer will
  be provisioned, but the service will still behave like a NodePort service (Lukša).
</NoteBox>

A LoadBalancer service is an extension of a NodePort service: it allows you to expose a service (externally) **using your cloud provider's load balancer.**

Kubernetes will automatically create the load balancer, provide firewall rules if needed, and populate the service with the external IP address assigned by the cloud provider (vmware.com).

      A LoadBalancer service provides an external IP to your service, using the cloud provider's
      load balancer.

## LoadBalancer service descriptor

<NoteBox type="warning">
  You can't fully experiment with LoadBalancer services on Minikube. Use GKE (Google Kubernetes
  Engine) or something.
</NoteBox>

Mention the service's `selector`, and the `ports` mapping.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubia-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  # pods that handle the service have these labels
  selector:
    app: kubia
  # You can mention `nodePort` here, but you don't have to
  # (you let Kubernetes choose the nodePort)
  ports:
    - # connect here if you use the service's internal IP
      port: 80
      # traffics will be routed here
      targetPort: 8080
```

## Connecting to a LoadBalancer service

You connect to your service using the service's **external IP**:

```bash
kubectl get svc kubia-loadbalancer
# NAME                 CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)         AGE
# kubia-loadbalancer   10.111.241.153   130.211.53.173   80:32143/TCP    1m

curl http://130.211.53.173
# You've hit kubia-xueq1
```
