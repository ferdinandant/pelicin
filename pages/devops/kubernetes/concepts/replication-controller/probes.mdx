# Probes: Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Probes

Probes are periodical checks (performed by Kubelet, every 10 seconds by default) that determine if your pod is healthy or is ready.

**Note that the checks are performed by Kubelet:** if the entire pod fails and you don't have something like ReplicationController, pods failing the probes will not be replaced.

## Types of probes

- **Liveness probes** &mdash; Checks to see if a container is running and healthy ("healthchecks"). If a container fails a liveness probe, Kubelet will restart it.
- **Readiness probes** &mdash; Checks to see if a container can receive client requests. A pod is ready if all of its containers are ready. If a pod is ready, it is added to the service; if a pod is not ready, it is removed from the service.
- **Startup probes** &mdash; Disables liveness probes and readiness probes for the container until this probe succeeds (can be used on slow starting containers).

## Probe descriptor

**Here's an example that adds a liveness probe to a container.** (Adding a readiness probe or a startup probe works similarly, but you use `readinessProbe` or `startupProbe` instead.)

In this example, Kubelet will hit the path `/healthcheck` on port 8080 and expects to get a non-error response (2xx or 3xx).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kubia-liveness
spec:
  containers:
    - image: luksa/kubia-unhealthy
      name: kubia
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /healthcheck
          port: 8080
```

## Types of probes

<NoteBox type="warning">
  <strong>If you are running a Java (JVM-based) app:</strong> use an HTTP get probe instead of an
  Exec probe because it will otherwise spin up a whole new JVM just to get the liveness information
  (you waste a considerable of resources).
</NoteBox>

There are three types of probes.

We use `livenessProbe` as an example, but you can also use these for `readinessProbe` or `startupProbe`.

### HTTP GET probe

Performs an HTTP GET request on the container's IP address, a port, and path you specify. Succeeds if it gets a non-error response (2xx or 3xx).

```yaml
# Under .spec.containers[i]:
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthcheck
    port: 8080
    httpHeaders:
      - name: Custom-Header
        value: Awesome
  initialDelaySeconds: 3
  periodSeconds: 3
```

### TCP socket probe

Opens a TCP connection to the specified port of the container. Succeeds if the connection is established successfully.

```yaml
# Under .spec.containers[i]:
livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 20
```

### Exec probe

Executes an arbitrary command inside the container. Succeeds if the command exited with exit code 0.

```yaml
# Under .spec.containers[i]:
readinessProbe:
  exec:
    # this works too:
    # command: ["cat", "/tmp/healthy"]
    command:
      - cat
      - /tmp/healthy
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

## Working with liveness probes

### Checking if a pod has been restarted

See the `RESTARTS` column.

```bash
kubectl get pod kubia-liveness
# NAME             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# kubia-liveness   1/1       Running   1          2m
```

### Checking why a pod is restarted

You can see the _previous_ pod's log:

```bash
kubectl logs <podName> --previous
```

Or see the pod's events:

```bash
kubectl describe po kubia-liveness
# ... (some other description)
# Events:
# ... Killing container with id docker://95246981:pod "kubia-liveness ..."
#     container "kubia" is unhealthy, it will be killed and re-created.
```
