# Labels and Selectors

## Labels

_Labels_ are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, e.g., pods. Labels make your cluster more organized, because you can query objects by their labels.

### Label keys and values

Label keys are in the form of `<prefix>/<name>` or `<name>`, where:

- prefixes are optional and must be a DNS subdomain
- prefixes of `kubernetes.io/` and `k8s.io/` are reserved for Kubernetes core components

Label values must be 63 character or less OR can be empty. Label values may contain alphanumeric characters, dots (`.`), dashes (`-`), and underscores (`_`).

### Example: a pod descriptor with labels

For example, a pod description with labels:

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: label-demo
  labels:
    environment: production
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Selectors

You can use selectors to query for a set of objects.

### Types of requirements

The Kubernetes API currently supports two types of selector _requirements_: (1) **equality-based requirement** and (2) **set-based requirement**.

#### Equality-based requirement

- **equality** &mdash; e.g. `environment = production`
- **inequality** &mdash; `tier != frontend`

(Note: you can also use `==` instead of `=`).

#### Set-based requirement

- **in** &mdash; e.g. `environment in (production, qa)`
- **not in** &mdash; e.g. `environment notin (production, qa)`
- **exists** &mdash; e.g. `environment` (look for anything that has label key `environment`, whatever the value)
- **not exists** &mdash; e.g. `!environment` (look for anything that DOESN'T HAVE label key `environment`, whatever the value)

### Specifiying multiple requirements

Use comma (`,`) to make an "AND" clause, e.g.,

```
tier in (fe, be), environment!=qa
```

will look for anything whose `tier` value is `fe` or `be`, AND whose `environment` value is NOT `qa`.
