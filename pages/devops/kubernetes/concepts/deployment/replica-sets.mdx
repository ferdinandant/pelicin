# Replica Sets

<NoteBox type="info">
  You don't usually create ReplicaSet directly. Instead, you would normally create them using{' '}
  <Link str="Deployments" link="/devops/kubernetes/concepts/deployment/deployments" />.
</NoteBox>

ReplicaSet ensures there are a certain number of pod-replicas (that match the given pod-label selectors) running in the cluster at any given time.

If there are too many pods, ReplicaSet will delete the excess pods; if there are too few, ReplicaSet will create new ones using the template.

**If you change or add a pod's label when ReplicaSet is in effect:** the number of matched pods may differ, and thus, pods will be deleted or created to accomodate.

## Relationship with ReplicationController

ReplicationController was the "older version" of ReplicaSet. Its selector capability is much limited (could only use the equality operator).

You should use ReplicaSet going forward.

## ReplicaSet descriptor

A sample ReplicaSet looks like the following. It mainly contains of 3 parts:

- **`replicas`** &mdash; how many replica of pods
- **`selector`** &mdash; pod label selectors
- **`template`** &mdash; how to create new pods

```yaml
# Note that this is not part of the core 'v1' API
# So you would use "apiVersion: apps/v1"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: kubia
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kubia
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kubia
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kubia
          image: luksa/kubia
```

## Type of selectors

You can use `matchLabels` and/or `matchExpressions`. If you specify both, it will select pods matching ALL the selectors.

### `matchLabels`

This will match pods whose `app` label value is `kubia`:

```yaml
# Under spec.selector:
matchLabels:
  app: kubia
```

### `matchExpressions`

Specify an array of expressions (it will select pods matching all the expressions):

- **`key`** &mdash; the label's key
- **`operator`** &mdash; could be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, or `DoesNotExist`
- **`values`** &mdash; required if you use the `In` or `NotIn` operator

```yaml
# Under spec.selector:
matchExpressions:
  - key: app
    operator: In
    values:
      - kubia
      - kubiu
```

## Working with ReplicaSet

<NoteBox type="info">
  ReplicaSet's abbreviation is <Code str="rs" />.
</NoteBox>

### Creating a ReplicaSet

```bash
kubectl create -f <filename>
```

### Listing ReplicaSets

```bash
kubectl get rs
# NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
# kubia     3         3         3         3s
```

### Describing a ReplicaSet

```bash
kubectl describe rs <replicaSetName>
# Name:           kubia
# Namespace:      default
# Selector:       app=kubia
# Labels:         app=kubia
# Annotations:    <none>
# Replicas:       3 current / 3 desired
# Pods Status:    3 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed
# Pod Template:
#   Labels:       app=kubia
#   Containers:   ...
#   Volumes:      <none>
# Events:         <none>
```

### Deleting a ReplicaSet

<NoteBox type="warning">Deleting a ReplicaSet will also delete all the matching pods.</NoteBox>

```bash
kubectl delete rs <replicaSetName>
```
