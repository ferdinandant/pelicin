# Daemon Sets

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a pod.

## Relationship with the Scheduler

**A DaemonSet bypasses the Scheduler completely.**

If you mark nodes as unschedulable (preventing pods from being deployed to them), a DaemonSet will still deploy pods to them.

## DaemonSet descriptor

The following example will deploy `luksa/ssd-monitor` pods on nodes that matches the `spec.template.spec.nodeSelector`.

The nodes watched by the DaemonSet itself if tagged with `app=ssd-monitor`. (See [ReplicaSet's types of selector](/devops/kubernetes/concepts/deployment/replica-sets#type-of-selectors) to see how you can select the pods.)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: ssd-monitor
spec:
  # The pods watched by DaemonSet are
  # those that match "app=ssd-monitor"
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ssd-monitor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ssd-monitor
    spec:
      # The pods that the DaemonSet will deploy to
      # matches "disk=ssd"
      nodeSelector:
        disk: ssd
      containers:
        - name: main
          image: luksa/ssd-monitor
```

Here's the illustration for the above case:

  path="/res/devops/kubernetes/daemonset-ssd-monitor.jpg"

      Deploying <Code str="ssd-monitor" /> pods on nodes with <Code str="disk=ssd" />.
    </>
  }
  sourceString={'Lukša'}
/>

## Working with DaemonSets

<NoteBox type="info">
  DaemonSet's abbreviation is <Code str="ds" />.
</NoteBox>

### Creating a DaemonSet

```bash
kubectl create -f <filename>
```

### Listing DaemonSets

```bash
kubectl get ds
```

### Describing a DaemonSet

```bash
kubectl describe ds <daemonSetName>
```

### Deleting a DaemonSet

```bash
kubectl delete <daemonSetName>
```
