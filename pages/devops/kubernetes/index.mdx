# Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of _containerized applications_ (kubernetes.io). The containerized applications typically run on Docker containers.

Kubernetes allows you to run thousands of computer nodes as if they were a single enormous computer (Lukša).

## Architecture of a Kubernetes cluster

A Kubernetes cluster consists of

- **the master node** &mdash; hosts _Kubernetes Control Plane_ that controls and manages the whole Kubernetes system
- **the worker nodes** &mdash; runs your applications

### The master node

There could be one or more master nodes (to ensure high availability).

The master node consists of

- **The Kubernetes API server** &mdash; the front-end of the control plane: lets the user interact with the Kubernetes cluster, also allows external components and parts of the cluster to communicate with each other
- **The Scheduler** &mdash; assigns pods (sets of containers that should be located on the same node) to nodes
- **The Controller Manager** &mdash; performs cluster-level functions (replicating components, keeping track of worker nodes, handling node failures, etc.)
- **etcd (key-value store)** &mdash; persistently stores cluster configuration

### The worker nodes

The worker nodes run your containerized applications (Lukša).

It contains

- **The Kubelet** &mdash; talks to the Kubernetes API server and manages containers on its node
- **The Kubernetes Service Proxy (kube-proxy)** load-balances traffic to the containers
- **The Container runtime** &mdash; e.g. Docker, runs your application containers
