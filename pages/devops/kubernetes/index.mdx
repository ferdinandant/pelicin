# Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of _containerized applications_ (kubernetes.io). The containerized applications typically run on Docker containers.

Kubernetes allows you to run thousands of computer nodes as if they were a single enormous computer (Lukša).

## Architecture of a Kubernetes cluster

A Kubernetes cluster consists of

- **the master node** &mdash; hosts _Kubernetes Control Plane_ that controls and manages the whole Kubernetes system
- **the worker nodes** &mdash; runs your applications

### The master node

There could be one or more master nodes (to ensure high availability).

The master node consists of

- **The Kubernetes API server** &mdash; the front-end of the control plane: lets the user interact with the Kubernetes cluster, also allows external components and parts of the cluster to communicate with each other
- **The Scheduler** &mdash; assigns pods (sets of containers that should be located on the same node) to nodes
- **The Controller Manager** &mdash; performs cluster-level functions (replicating components, keeping track of worker nodes, handling node failures, etc.)
- **etcd (key-value store)** &mdash; persistently stores cluster configuration

### The worker nodes

The worker nodes run your containerized applications (Lukša).

It contains

- **The Kubelet** &mdash; talks to the Kubernetes API server and manages containers on its node
- **The Kubernetes Service Proxy (kube-proxy)** load-balances traffic to the containers
- **The Container runtime** &mdash; e.g. Docker, runs your application containers

## Running an application in Kubernetes

The typical steps to run an application in Kubernetes:

1. package the application to one or more container images,
2. push the image to an image registry,
3. post a description of the application to the Kubernetes API server.

### The application description

The description of the application posted to the Kubernetes API server includes:

- the application pods/containers
- how the containers are related to each other
- which containers need to be co-located (put in the same pod)
- how many copies ("replicas") of each pods
- which pods provide service to internal/external clients (should be exposed through a single IP address)

## Benefits of Kubernetes

According to Lukša,

- **Simplifying application deployment** &mdash; You treat the cluster as a single deployment platform, don't need to care about the servers that make up the cluster. (You can specify requirementssuch as requiring the container to run on a node with SSDs instead of HDDs, though.)
- **Achieving better utilization of hardware** &mdash; Let the Kubernetes choose the most appropriate nodes to run your application. It can move pods/containers around (accross nodes) to tightly pack the worker nodes (achieving more efficient node utilization).
- **Health-checking and self-healing** &mdash; Kubernetes monitors the containers and nodes they run on, and reschedules them accordingly (to a new node) in case of node failure
- **Automatic scaling** &mdash; Kubernetes can be told to monitor resource usage and scale each pods/containers accordingly.
